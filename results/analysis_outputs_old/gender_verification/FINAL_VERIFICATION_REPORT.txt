Generated: 2025-11-15 18:42:19

=== EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ===
Research Question: Does gender moderate UCLA-WCST relationship?
Reported Finding: β = 2.5944, p = 0.0042 ***

Verification Results:
✅ Effect is REAL (robust to outliers, permutation stable, bootstrap CI excludes 0)
❌ Statistical rigor FAILS (multiple testing correction, severely underpowered)

=== KEY FINDINGS ===
1. Data Quality: ✅ All checks passed
2. Reproducibility: ✅ Exact replication of reported coefficients
3. Model Sensitivity: ⚠️ p varies 0.004-0.059 depending on covariates
4. Outlier Robustness: ✅ Remains significant after outlier removal
5. Permutation Stability: ✅ All seeds p < 0.01
6. Bootstrap CI: ✅ [0.78, 4.41] excludes 0
7. Multiple Testing: ❌ Fails Bonferroni (p=0.029 > α=0.0167)
8. Statistical Power: ❌ 10% (needs N=1,290 for 80%)

=== RECOMMENDATION ===
Publication: CONDITIONAL
- Report as "exploratory finding"
- Explicitly state multiple testing failure and power limitations
- Emphasize need for independent replication with N ≥ 1,290
- Consider Bayesian approach as supplementary analysis

Status: VERIFIED BUT UNDERPOWERED
