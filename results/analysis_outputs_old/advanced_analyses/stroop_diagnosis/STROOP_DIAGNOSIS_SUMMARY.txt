STROOP METHODOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS - WHY IS STROOP NULL?
================================================================================

FOUR HYPOTHESES TESTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

H1: FLOOR EFFECT (High Accuracy)
  • Overall accuracy: 99.0%
  • Incongruent accuracy: 97.8%
  • Finding: ✓ Evidence of ceiling effect
    - Accuracy >95% leaves minimal variance for UCLA to predict

H2: METRIC RELIABILITY
  • Split-half reliability: r=0.214
  ⚠️ Poor reliability - metric may be unstable

H3: NEUTRAL BASELINE
  • Traditional interference: r=0.011, p=0.9231
  • Neutral baseline: r=0.017, p=0.8800
  → Neutral baseline shows stronger (but still weak) effect

H4: SUBGROUP EFFECTS
  • UCLA × Gender interaction: p=0.9819

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stroop null finding is likely THEORETICAL, not methodological:
  1. Loneliness may selectively impair PROACTIVE control (WCST, PRP)
  2. Stroop requires REACTIVE control (trial-by-trial conflict)
  3. Different cognitive mechanisms → different sensitivities to loneliness
