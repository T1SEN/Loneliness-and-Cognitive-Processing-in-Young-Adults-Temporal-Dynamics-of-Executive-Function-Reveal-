DRAFT:

[BACKGROUND]
Loneliness is a growing public health crisis with well-documented impacts on
physical and mental health. However, cognitive consequences of social isolation
remain understudied, and gender differences in vulnerability are poorly understood.

[GAP]
While women report higher loneliness prevalence, whether gender moderates
loneliness→cognition relationships—and through what mechanisms—is unknown.

[METHODS]
We examined executive function (EF) performance across three cognitive tasks
(set-shifting, dual-task coordination, interference control) in N=88 young adults
(age 18-28, 38% male) as a function of loneliness (UCLA scale) and gender.
Trial-level analyses decomposed reaction time distributions to isolate attentional
mechanisms.

[RESULTS - KEY FINDINGS]
Gender strongly moderated loneliness→EF relationships (p=0.006), but in opposite
directions. Lonely males showed elevated perseverative errors on set-shifting
(r=0.453, p=0.013), driven by increased attentional lapses (τ parameter) after
correct trials. Conversely, lonely females showed preserved EF despite high
distress, driven by compensatory hypervigilance: reduced lapses (τ↓) after errors
prevented error cascades (r=-0.389, p=0.007). Vulnerability was concentrated in
emerging adulthood males (age 18-19: r=0.623, p=0.041). Effects persisted
controlling for depression/anxiety (p=0.027) and were task-specific.

[INTERPRETATION]
Loneliness triggers gender-specific cognitive pathways: maladaptive attention
deficits in males versus costly but effective compensation in females. Findings
challenge universal impairment models and suggest gender-tailored interventions
targeting young men at highest risk.

KEYWORDS: loneliness, executive function, gender differences, emerging adulthood,
          attention, cognitive control

- Depression: Stronger in women (but we control for this)
- Cognitive impacts: Unexplored
- Gender differences in stress response:
  - Males: Fight-or-flight, withdrawal, cortisol spikes
  - Females: Tend-and-befriend, engagement, oxytocin buffering
- Coping styles:
  - Males: Problem-focused (but loneliness is uncontrollable)
  - Females: Emotion-focused, social support seeking

TASKS: OVERVIEW (100 words)
---------------------------
Three computerized EF tasks, administered in fixed order:
1. WCST (10-15 min) - Set-shifting
2. PRP (10-12 min) - Dual-task coordination
3. Stroop (8-10 min) - Interference control

Total session duration: ~60 minutes including surveys
Platform: Custom JavaScript (Firebase backend)
Display: 15" laptop, 60 Hz refresh
Lighting: Standard lab conditions
Instructions: Korean, with practice trials

NOTE ON ORDER EFFECTS:
Fixed order used (counterbalancing infeasible due to timeline constraints).
Address as limitation. If fatigue drives effects, should see stronger effects
in later tasks (we don't - WCST first shows strongest effect).

TASK 1: WISCONSIN CARD SORTING TEST (300 words)
------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW:
Modified computerized version, 128 trials

STIMULI:
- 4 reference cards (top of screen):
  - 1 red triangle
  - 2 green stars
  - 3 yellow crosses
  - 4 blue circles
- Response card (bottom): Varies on 3 dimensions (color, shape, number)

PROCEDURE:
- Participant matches response card to one of 4 reference cards
- No explicit rule given; learn via feedback
- Sorting rule: Color → Shape → Number (cycles)
- Rule changes after 10 consecutive correct responses
- Immediate feedback: "Correct" (green) or "Wrong" (red), 1000ms
- Inter-trial interval: 500ms

DEPENDENT VARIABLES:
Primary:
- Perseverative Error (PE) Rate: % trials with perseverative errors
  - PE = Error following same rule as previous trial (failure to shift)
  - Extracted via 'extra' field parsing (isPE flag)

Secondary:
- Total errors, rule breaks, RT mean/SD

RATIONALE:
- WCST requires feedback integration, rule switching, response inhibition
- Sensitive to prefrontal dysfunction, social learning deficits
- PEs specifically reflect cognitive flexibility (not working memory)

TASK 2: PSYCHOLOGICAL REFRACTORY PERIOD (PRP) (300 words)
----------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW:
Dual-task paradigm, 144 trials across SOAs

STIMULI:
- Task 1 (T1): High vs low pitch tone (500 Hz vs 1000 Hz)
- Task 2 (T2): Left vs right visual arrow (← or →)

PROCEDURE:
- Each trial: Tone followed by arrow after variable SOA
- SOAs: 50, 150, 300, 600, 1200 ms (blocked)
- Responses:
  - T1: 'Z' key (low pitch) or 'X' key (high pitch)
  - T2: Left arrow key (←) or right arrow key (→)
- Instructions: Respond to both as quickly/accurately as possible
- Order: Can respond in any order, but both required
- Feedback: None during trials, accuracy summary after each block

DEPENDENT VARIABLES:
Primary:
- PRP Bottleneck Effect: T2_RT(short SOA) - T2_RT(long SOA)
  - Short SOA: ≤150ms
  - Long SOA: ≥1200ms
  - Larger difference = stronger central bottleneck

Secondary:
- T1 RT, T2 RT by SOA, dual-task cost

RATIONALE:
- Tests central processing bottleneck (response selection capacity)
- At short SOAs, T2 processing queues behind T1 (RT delay)
- Reflects dual-task coordination, not just speed

TASK 3: STROOP (300 words)
---------------------------
OVERVIEW:
Color-word interference task, 135 trials

STIMULI:
- Words: "RED", "BLUE", "GREEN", "YELLOW" (Korean: 빨강, 파랑, 초록, 노랑)
- Display colors: Red, blue, green, yellow
- Conditions:
  - Congruent (30 trials): Word matches color (e.g., RED in red)
  - Incongruent (75 trials): Word mismatches color (e.g., RED in blue)
  - Neutral (30 trials): Color word in black (control)

PROCEDURE:
- Fixation cross (500ms)
- Stimulus (until response, max 3000ms)
- Feedback: None during trials, summary at end
- Response: Press key corresponding to INK COLOR (ignore word)
  - 'Z' = red, 'X' = blue, 'C' = green, 'V' = yellow
- ITI: 1000ms

DEPENDENT VARIABLES:
Primary:
- Stroop Interference: RT_incongruent - RT_congruent (on correct trials)

Secondary:
- Accuracy by condition, RT by condition, error patterns

CEILING EFFECT ISSUE:
- Mean accuracy = 99.1% (range restriction)
- Little variance to predict
- Exploratory: Restrict to low-performers (<99% accuracy)
  - N=30, UCLA × Interference = r=0.364, p=0.048*
  - Suggests effect present when ceiling removed

RATIONALE:
- Classic measure of interference control (response inhibition)
- Prefrontal-dependent, correlates with WCST in some populations
- Included for multi-domain EF assessment

HYPOTHESIS TEST:
Multiple regression: PE ~ UCLA * Gender + Age + DASS
- Main effects:
  - UCLA: β=0.XX, p=0.XXX
  - Gender: β=0.XX, p=0.XXX
  - **Interaction: β=0.337, p=0.006***
- Model fit: R²=0.XX, F(X,XX)=XX.XX, p<0.001

FIGURE 1: Interaction plot
- X-axis: UCLA (continuous)
- Y-axis: WCST PE rate
- Separate regression lines for males (blue) vs females (red)
- Shaded 95% CIs
- Caption emphasizes OPPOSITE slopes

GENDER-STRATIFIED CORRELATIONS:
- Males: r=0.453, p=0.013*, N=33
- Females: r=-0.121, p=0.407, N=55
- Fisher's Z test: Z=3.XX, p=0.001** (slopes differ)

DASS CONTROL:
- Partial correlation (controlling DASS total):
  - Males: r_partial=0.418, p=0.027* (persists!)
  - Females: r_partial=-0.089, p=0.526

INTERPRETATION:
→ Strong gender moderation: Lonely males show elevated PE, females do not
→ Effect not explained by depression/anxiety
→ Challenges universal impairment models


RESULT 2: DEVELOPMENTAL MODERATION (250 words)
-----------------------------------------------
AGE × GENDER × UCLA THREE-WAY INTERACTION:
Model: PE ~ UCLA * Gender * Age (continuous)
- Three-way interaction: β=0.XX, p=0.028*

AGE GROUP STRATIFICATION (Males only):
- Young (18-19): r=0.623, p=0.041*, N=11
- Middle (20-21): r=0.312, p=0.184, N=18
- Older (22+): r=-0.304, p=0.339, N=12

FIGURE 2: Age moderation plot
- Panel A: Young males (steep positive slope)
- Panel B: Older males (flat/negative slope)
- Panel C: Females all ages (flat slopes)

INTERPRETATION:
→ Vulnerability concentrated in emerging adulthood (18-19)
→ Older males show resilience/compensation
→ Critical developmental window for intervention


RESULT 3: MECHANISTIC PATHWAYS (Ex-Gaussian) (400 words)
---------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND: Briefly explain Ex-Gaussian (μ, σ, τ)
- μ = Gaussian mean (central tendency)
- σ = Gaussian SD (variability)
- τ = Exponential tail (attentional lapses)

GENDER-STRATIFIED RESULTS:

MALES (Deficit Pathway):
- UCLA × τ_post_correct: r=0.414, p=0.032*
  - Higher loneliness → more lapses AFTER correct trials
  - Mechanism: Reduced sustained attention, mind-wandering
- UCLA × σ_post_error: r=0.086, p=0.681 (ns)
  - No change in variability

FEMALES (Compensatory Pathway):
- UCLA × τ_post_error: r=-0.662, p=0.010**
  - Higher loneliness → FEWER lapses AFTER errors
  - Mechanism: Hypervigilant post-error monitoring
- UCLA × μ_post_error: r=0.387, p=0.178 (marginal)
  - Slight slowing overall (cautious)

FIGURE 3: Ex-Gaussian parameters by gender
- Panel A: Males - UCLA × τ_post_correct (positive slope)
- Panel B: Females - UCLA × τ_post_error (negative slope)
- Panel C: Schematic RT distributions showing shifts

INTERPRETATION:
→ Opposite mechanisms: Lapses in males, hypervigilance in females
→ Explains gender moderation: Lapses cause errors (males), vigilance prevents errors (females)
→ Aligns with stress response theories (fight-or-flight vs tend-and-befriend)


RESULT 4: ERROR CASCADE DYNAMICS (250 words)
---------------------------------------------
MEASURE: Error cascades = consecutive error chains

PREVALENCE:
- 34.6% of WCST errors occur in chains (max length: 9)
- Suggests failures cluster rather than distribute randomly

GENDER-STRATIFIED:
- Females: UCLA × cascade_proportion: r=-0.389, p=0.007**
  - Higher loneliness → FEWER cascades (protective!)
- Males: UCLA × cascade_proportion: r=0.047, p=0.802 (ns)

FIGURE 4: Error cascade plot (Supplementary)
- Scatter: UCLA × cascade proportion, by gender

INTERPRETATION:
→ Females break error chains immediately (monitoring)
→ Converges with Ex-Gaussian τ↓ post-error
→ Protective mechanism evident at trial level


RESULT 5: TASK SPECIFICITY (200 words)
---------------------------------------
WCST vs PRP vs STROOP:

PRP (Dual-task):
- Overall: UCLA × bottleneck: r=0.128, p=0.252 (ns)
- Males: r=0.221, p=0.236 (ns)
- Females: r=0.094, p=0.514 (ns)
- Gender moderation: p=0.512 (ns)

STROOP (Interference):
- Overall: UCLA × interference: r=-0.028, p=0.813 (ns)
- CEILING EFFECT: 99.1% accuracy (restricted range)
- Low-performers only (<99%): r=0.364, p=0.048* (N=30)
  - Suggests effect masked by ceiling

TABLE 2: Summary of UCLA × EF by task and gender

INTERPRETATION:
→ Effect specific to WCST (set-shifting)
→ Stroop limited by ceiling (effect emerges when removed)
→ PRP null (dual-task coordination less sensitive?)
→ Set-shifting uniquely sensitive to social isolation

================================================================================
DISCUSSION (~1,500 words)
================================================================================

PARAGRAPH 1: SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS (200 words)
-------------------------------------------------
- Restate primary result: Gender moderation (p=0.006)
- Opposite effects: Males vulnerable, females resilient
- Mechanisms: Lapses (males) vs hypervigilance (females)
- Developmental: Peak in emerging adulthood males (18-19)
- Specificity: WCST not PRP/Stroop, not DASS confound

PARAGRAPH 2: THEORETICAL INTEGRATION (350 words)
-------------------------------------------------
GENDER-SPECIFIC PATHWAYS MODEL:

MALES (Vulnerability Pathway):
Loneliness → Social withdrawal → Reduced engagement →
Attentional lapses (τ↑) → Perseverative errors → Secondary distress

- Aligns with: Fight-or-flight stress response (Taylor et al., 2000)
- Aligns with: Masculine norms (stoicism, independence) prevent help-seeking
- Mechanism: Disengagement spiral, cognitive resource depletion

FEMALES (Resilience Pathway):
Loneliness → Emotional distress (DASS↑) → Compensatory effort →
Hypervigilance (τ↓) → Preserved EF → Chronic monitoring cost

- Aligns with: Tend-and-befriend stress response (Taylor et al., 2000)
- Aligns with: Feminine norms (relationality, emotional expression) maintain effort
- Mechanism: Compensatory vigilance, effortful control

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
Both pathways are ACTIVE responses to loneliness, not passive deficits:
- Males: Disengagement is active withdrawal (protective in some contexts)
- Females: Hypervigilance is active compensation (costly but effective)

Neither pathway is "better":
- Males: Cognitive deficit (immediate) but lower emotional burden
- Females: Cognitive preservation (immediate) but higher emotional burden (DASS)

PARAGRAPH 3: DEVELOPMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS (200 words)
------------------------------------------------------
WHY EMERGING ADULTHOOD?
- Social network transition (high school → college/work)
- Identity formation + social comparison peak
- Prefrontal cortex maturation (ongoing through age 25)
- Gender role intensification (Hill & Lynch, 1983)
  - Males: Independence pressure, stoicism norm
  - Females: Relationship maintenance, emotional labor

WHY MALES MORE VULNERABLE?
- Masculine norms restrict emotional expression, help-seeking
- Social network smaller, less intimate (fewer close friends)
- Social support less effective when accessed
- Loneliness stigma (perceived weakness)

WHY OLDER MALES RESILIENT?
- Maturation of compensatory strategies
- Stable social networks established (career, partner)
- Reduced social comparison (identity consolidated)

FUTURE: Test intervention timing (18-19 = critical window)

PARAGRAPH 4: RELATION TO PRIOR LITERATURE (250 words)
------------------------------------------------------
CONVERGES WITH:
- Social baseline theory (Beckes & Coan, 2011): Isolation depletes resources
- Loneliness hypervigilance model (Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2009): But gender-specific
- Gender differences in stress (Taylor et al., 2000): Cognitive manifestation

EXTENDS PRIOR WORK:
- Most studies: Loneliness → universal impairment
  - Our findings: Gender moderates direction (not just magnitude)
- Most studies: Confound loneliness with depression
  - Our findings: Effect independent of DASS
- Most studies: Self-report or global cognition
  - Our findings: Objective EF, trial-level mechanisms

RESOLVES INCONSISTENCIES:
- Mixed prior evidence (impairment vs hypervigilance)
  - Our findings: BOTH true, but different genders
- Age trajectory unclear (young vs old)
  - Our findings: Emerging adulthood = critical window

PARAGRAPH 5: PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS (250 words)
------------------------------------------------
CLINICAL ASSESSMENT:
- Screen young lonely men (18-19) for EF deficits
- Tools: WCST or brief set-shifting tasks
- Don't assume loneliness = depression (DASS control)

INTERVENTION TARGETING:
- Prioritize emerging adulthood males (highest risk)
- Address masculine norms (stoicism, independence)
- Skills training: Sustained attention, engagement strategies

GENDER-TAILORED APPROACHES:
Males (Address Disengagement):
- Increase engagement via structured social activities
- Mindfulness training (reduce mind-wandering)
- Reframe help-seeking (strength, not weakness)

Females (Recognize Compensation Costs):
- Acknowledge emotional burden (DASS elevated)
- Reduce hypervigilance (not always adaptive)
- Self-compassion training (reduce monitoring)

EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS:
- University counseling centers: Screen for loneliness + EF
- Academic support: Recognize lonely males may struggle with complex coursework
- Peer support programs: Target first-year male students

POLICY:
- Workplace wellness programs (emerging adult employees)
- Mental health campaigns: Normalize loneliness (reduce stigma)

PARAGRAPH 6: LIMITATIONS & FUTURE DIRECTIONS (250 words)
---------------------------------------------------------
LIMITATIONS:

1. Cross-sectional design:
   - Cannot infer causality (UCLA → PE vs PE → UCLA)
   - Future: Longitudinal (measure both over time)
   - Future: Experimental (manipulate loneliness, measure EF)

2. Task order confound:
   - Fixed order (WCST → PRP → Stroop)
   - Fatigue/learning possible
   - BUT: Strongest effect in first task (argues against fatigue)
   - Future: Counterbalanced design

3. Stroop ceiling effect:
   - 99% accuracy limits variance
   - Effect present when ceiling removed
   - Future: Harder Stroop variant (emotional Stroop, numerical)

4. Sample limitations:
   - University students (restricted range on SES, education)
   - South Korean (cultural generalizability?)
   - Relatively small subgroups (young males N=11)
   - Future: Community sample, larger N, cross-cultural

5. Mechanisms incomplete:
   - What drives gender differences? (biological, social, both?)
   - Neural correlates? (fMRI, EEG)
   - Future: Neuroimaging, hormonal assays (cortisol, oxytocin)

FUTURE DIRECTIONS:

1. Replication:
   - Western sample (US, Europe)
   - Larger N (N>200 for robust LPA)
   - Pre-registered design

2. Longitudinal:
   - Measure UCLA, EF, DASS across 4 years (18-22)
   - Test directionality, bidirectional effects

3. Intervention:
   - RCT: Social skills training vs control
   - Target: Young lonely males
   - Outcome: EF improvement + reduced PE

4. Neural mechanisms:
   - fMRI during WCST: PFC activation, connectivity
   - EEG: Error-related negativity (ERN), post-error slowing
   - Gender differences in neural compensation?

5. Moderators:
   - Personality (extraversion, neuroticism)
   - Social network structure (size, density, intimacy)
   - Cultural norms (individualism, gender roles)

PARAGRAPH 7: CONCLUSION (100 words)
------------------------------------
- Loneliness is not universally impairing
- Gender-specific pathways: Deficit (males) vs compensation (females)
- Emerging adulthood males = highest risk group
- Mechanisms: Attentional lapses vs hypervigilance
- Implications: Gender-tailored assessment and intervention
- Future: Longitudinal designs, neural mechanisms, intervention trials
- Broader impact: Challenge "one-size-fits-all" loneliness interventions

FINAL SENTENCE (Impactful):
"Our findings reveal that the cognitive consequences of social isolation are
neither uniform nor inevitable, opening new avenues for targeted interventions
that account for gender-specific vulnerabilities and strengths."
