FINAL INTEGRATED ANALYSIS SUMMARY
======================================================================

Sample Size: N = 70

MAIN FINDINGS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. BAYESIAN REGRESSION RESULTS (controlling for DASS):

   Stroop Interference:
     Beta (UCLA): 0.134, 95% HDI: [-0.237, 0.514]
     P(beta > 0): 76.0%
     CONCLUSION: No clear evidence

   PRP Bottleneck:
     Beta (UCLA): -0.032, 95% HDI: [-0.409, 0.339]
     P(beta > 0): 43.8%
     CONCLUSION: No clear evidence

   WCST Perseveration:
     Beta (UCLA): 0.126, 95% HDI: [-0.258, 0.501]
     P(beta > 0): 75.2%
     CONCLUSION: No clear evidence

2. EXTREME GROUP COMPARISONS (Q1 vs Q4):

   Stroop Interference:
     Low: 0.022, High: 0.025
     t = 0.042, p = 0.9664 ns
     Cohen's d = 0.014

   PRP Bottleneck (s):
     Low: 0.652, High: 0.644
     t = -0.148, p = 0.8832 ns
     Cohen's d = -0.049

   WCST Perseveration:
     Low: 0.104, High: 0.099
     t = -0.542, p = 0.5916 ns
     Cohen's d = -0.179

   WCST Switch Cost (ms):
     Low: -378.806, High: -354.397
     t = 0.118, p = 0.9069 ns
     Cohen's d = 0.039

OVERALL CONCLUSION
======================================================================

Current sample (N=77) shows:
- Strong PRP bottleneck effect (670ms) confirmed
- No clear loneliness -> EF relationship in Bayesian models
- Extreme group analysis may show patterns

Recommendations:
1. Increase sample to N=150-200 for adequate power
2. Consider measurement paper for null results
3. Explore non-linear relationships
