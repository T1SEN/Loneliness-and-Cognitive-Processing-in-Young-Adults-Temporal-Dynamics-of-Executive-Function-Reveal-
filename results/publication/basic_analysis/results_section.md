# Results

## Participant Characteristics

A total of 198 participants completed the study. Three participants had missing gender data, leaving 195 participants (78 male, 40.0%; 117 female, 60.0%) for gender-stratified analyses. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 36 years (*M* = 20.47, *SD* = 3.64). Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for all study variables.

UCLA Loneliness scores ranged from 20 to 70 (*M* = 40.50, *SD* = 10.97), indicating substantial variability in loneliness levels. DASS-21 subscale scores were as follows: Depression (*M* = 7.63, *SD* = 7.77), Anxiety (*M* = 5.58, *SD* = 5.73), and Stress (*M* = 9.92, *SD* = 7.51). Executive function performance metrics included WCST perseverative error rate (*M* = 10.54%, *SD* = 6.00), WCST accuracy (*M* = 82.45%, *SD* = 10.52), Stroop interference effect (*M* = 137.19 ms, *SD* = 103.08), and PRP delay effect (*M* = 582.42 ms, *SD* = 154.21).

### Gender Differences

Independent samples *t*-tests revealed significant gender differences on several psychological measures (see Table 1). Women reported significantly higher loneliness than men (*M* = 41.94, *SD* = 10.67 vs. *M* = 38.12, *SD* = 11.08), *t*(193) = -2.41, *p* = .017, Cohen's *d* = -0.35. Women also reported significantly higher depression symptoms (*M* = 8.56, *SD* = 7.72 vs. *M* = 5.95, *SD* = 7.02), *t*(192) = -2.39, *p* = .018, *d* = -0.35.

For executive function measures, a significant gender difference emerged only for the PRP delay effect, with women showing larger dual-task costs than men (*M* = 626.29 ms, *SD* = 146.71 vs. *M* = 527.02 ms, *SD* = 137.24), *t*(186) = -4.68, *p* < .001, *d* = -0.69. No significant gender differences were observed for WCST perseverative error rate (*p* = .929), WCST accuracy (*p* = .104), or Stroop interference effect (*p* = .133).

## Preliminary Analyses: Correlations

### UCLA Loneliness and Emotional Distress

Bivariate Pearson correlations were computed among all study variables (see Table 2 and Figure 1). As expected, UCLA Loneliness scores were strongly correlated with all three DASS-21 subscales: Depression (*r* = .66, 95% CI [.57, .73], *p* < .001), Anxiety (*r* = .49, 95% CI [.37, .59], *p* < .001), and Stress (*r* = .52, 95% CI [.41, .62], *p* < .001). These substantial correlations confirmed the theoretical rationale for controlling DASS-21 symptoms in subsequent analyses testing UCLA-executive function associations.

### UCLA Loneliness and Executive Function

Zero-order correlations between UCLA Loneliness and executive function metrics were uniformly small and non-significant: WCST perseverative error rate (*r* = -.10, 95% CI [-.24, .04], *p* = .169), WCST accuracy (*r* = .06, 95% CI [-.08, .20], *p* = .372), Stroop interference effect (*r* = -.01, 95% CI [-.15, .13], *p* = .902), and PRP delay effect (*r* = .12, 95% CI [-.02, .26], *p* = .092). Thus, even at the zero-order level without statistical controls, loneliness showed no significant bivariate relationship with any executive function measure.

### Inter-Task Correlations

Among executive function measures, WCST perseverative error rate and WCST accuracy were strongly negatively correlated (*r* = -.62, *p* < .001), as expected given that perseverative errors directly reduce accuracy. A modest positive correlation was observed between Stroop interference and PRP delay effect (*r* = .16, *p* = .026), suggesting some shared variance between interference control and dual-task coordination costs.

## Primary Analyses: Hierarchical Regression

To test whether loneliness predicted executive function performance independent of emotional distress symptoms, hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted for each executive function outcome. The model-building sequence was as follows: Step 0 included demographic covariates (age and gender); Step 1 added DASS-21 subscales (depression, anxiety, stress) to control for emotional distress; Step 2 added UCLA Loneliness to test the main effect; and Step 3 added the UCLA × Gender interaction term. All predictors were standardized (z-scored) prior to analysis, and heteroscedasticity-consistent (HC3) robust standard errors were used for all tests. Results are summarized in Table 3.

### WCST Perseverative Error Rate

The addition of DASS-21 subscales at Step 1 did not significantly improve model fit over demographics alone, Delta*R*^2^ = .020, *F*(3, 186) = 1.29, *p* = .278. The UCLA Loneliness main effect at Step 2 was not significant, *b* = -0.14, *SE* = 0.56, *t* = -0.25, *p* = .800, Delta*R*^2^ < .001. The UCLA × Gender interaction at Step 3 was also non-significant, *b* = 0.53, *SE* = 0.70, *p* = .451, Delta*R*^2^ = .002. Gender-stratified analyses revealed no significant UCLA effects for either women (*b* = -0.28, *p* = .721) or men (*b* = 0.22, *p* = .814).

### WCST Accuracy

Adding DASS-21 subscales at Step 1 did not significantly improve prediction, Delta*R*^2^ = .027, *p* = .161. The UCLA main effect was non-significant, *b* = 0.42, *SE* = 1.13, *t* = 0.37, *p* = .713, Delta*R*^2^ < .001. The interaction term was also non-significant, *b* = -1.45, *SE* = 1.13, *p* = .200, Delta*R*^2^ = .005. Gender-stratified effects were non-significant for both women (*b* = 1.09, *p* = .494) and men (*b* = -0.74, *p* = .678).

### Stroop Interference Effect

DASS-21 subscales did not significantly predict Stroop interference, Delta*R*^2^ = .007, *p* = .699. The UCLA main effect was non-significant, *b* = 7.46, *SE* = 10.44, *t* = 0.72, *p* = .475, Delta*R*^2^ = .003. The interaction effect was also non-significant, *b* = 6.96, *SE* = 14.84, *p* = .639, Delta*R*^2^ = .001. Gender-stratified analyses showed non-significant effects for women (*b* = 3.59, *p* = .792) and men (*b* = 13.88, *p* = .448).

### PRP Delay Effect

DASS-21 subscales did not significantly predict PRP delay, Delta*R*^2^ = .003, *p* = .911. The UCLA main effect approached but did not reach significance, *b* = 25.16, *SE* = 15.28, *t* = 1.65, *p* = .102, Delta*R*^2^ = .015. The interaction term was also non-significant, *b* = 30.66, *SE* = 20.25, *p* = .130, Delta*R*^2^ = .010. Gender-stratified analyses revealed non-significant UCLA effects for both women (*b* = 13.98, *p* = .478) and men (*b* = 30.43, *p* = .165), though the pattern suggested a numerically larger association in men.

### Regression Diagnostics

Multicollinearity was assessed using variance inflation factors (VIF), with maximum VIF values ranging from 2.45 to 2.46 across models, well below conventional thresholds of concern (VIF < 10). Breusch-Pagan tests indicated no significant heteroscedasticity for any outcome (all *p*s > .39). Shapiro-Wilk tests revealed non-normal residual distributions for three of four outcomes (*p*s < .001), justifying the use of HC3 robust standard errors.

*Note.* Step 0 (baseline) included age and gender. Step 1 added DASS-21 depression, anxiety, and stress subscales. Step 2 added UCLA Loneliness (main effect). Step 3 added the UCLA × Gender interaction. All predictors were z-scored. *b* = unstandardized regression coefficient for UCLA at Step 2. HC3 robust standard errors used for all Wald tests.

## Summary of Findings

Across all four executive function outcomes, UCLA Loneliness failed to significantly predict performance after controlling for DASS-21 emotional distress symptoms. All UCLA main effect *p*-values exceeded .10 (range: *p* = .102 to *p* = .800). Similarly, no UCLA × Gender interactions reached statistical significance (all *p*s > .13). Notably, the DASS-21 subscales themselves also failed to significantly predict executive function performance as a set (all Delta*R*^2^ < .03, all *p*s > .16), suggesting that neither loneliness nor general emotional distress directly impacted inhibitory control, set-shifting, or dual-task coordination in this sample of young adults.
