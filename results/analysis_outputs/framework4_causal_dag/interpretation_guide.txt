FRAMEWORK 4: CAUSAL DAG SIMULATION
Interpretation Guide
======================================================================

RESEARCH QUESTION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Which causal model best explains Gender × UCLA → EF patterns?

COMPETING MODELS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Model A: Mood-Driven (DASS → EF only, UCLA spurious)
Model B: Full Mediation (UCLA → DASS → EF)
Model C: Parallel Paths (UCLA → EF + DASS → EF)
Model D: Moderated Mediation (Gender moderates paths)

MODEL SELECTION CRITERIA:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- LOO (Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation): Lower is better
- WAIC (Widely Applicable Information Criterion): Lower is better
- Difference >4: Substantial evidence for better model
- Difference <4: Models are similar

INTERPRETATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If Model A (Mood-Driven) wins:
  → UCLA effects are spurious (confounded with DASS)
  → Intervention: Target mood, not loneliness

If Model B (Full Mediation) wins:
  → UCLA affects EF ONLY through DASS
  → Intervention: Either target loneliness OR mood

If Model C (Parallel Paths) wins:
  → UCLA has DIRECT effect on EF (beyond mood)
  → Intervention: Must target both loneliness AND mood

If Model D (Moderated Mediation) wins:
  → Gender-specific mechanisms
  → Intervention: Personalize by gender

LIMITATIONS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Cross-sectional data: Cannot establish temporal precedence
- Unobserved confounders: May bias results
- Model fit ≠ causal truth: Multiple models may fit equally
- Results are HYPOTHESIS-GENERATING, not confirmatory
- Need longitudinal/experimental data for causal claims

NEXT STEPS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Longitudinal study to test temporal ordering
2. Experimental manipulation of UCLA/DASS
3. Measure additional confounders (personality, SES, etc.)
4. Cross-validate best model in independent sample
