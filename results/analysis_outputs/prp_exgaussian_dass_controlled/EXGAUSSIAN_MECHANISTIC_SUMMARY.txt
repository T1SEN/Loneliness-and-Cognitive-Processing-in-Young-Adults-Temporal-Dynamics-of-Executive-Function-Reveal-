Ex-Gaussian Decomposition Results:
==================================

Overall RT Components (N=172):
- μ (Gaussian mean): 622.7 ms (routine processing)
- σ (Gaussian SD): 178.2 ms (trial-to-trial variability)
- τ (Exponential tail): 401.5 ms (attentional lapses)

Key Question: Which component drives male UCLA → RT variability?

Findings:
---------

No significant interactions found at p < 0.10
Possible reasons:
  1. Insufficient sample size (N=172)
  2. Overall RT variability (IQR) is composite of μ, σ, τ effects
  3. Need trial-level mixed models for more power


Cross-Reference to Previous Finding:
------------------------------------
- Previous analysis: Males show UCLA → T2 RT IQR (β = 76.98, p = 0.032*)
- Current analysis: Decomposes IQR into Ex-Gaussian components
- Interpretation depends on which parameter(s) show interaction

Theoretical Implications:
-------------------------
IF σ interaction: Males have inconsistent processing speed (reactive control failure)
IF τ interaction: Males have more attentional lapses (sustained attention failure)
IF BOTH: Males show dual deficit in speed consistency AND attention maintenance

Next Steps:
-----------
1. Trial-level mixed-effects models (more power than participant-level)
2. Larger sample size (current N=172 may be underpowered for Ex-Gaussian)
3. Neural correlates: EEG markers of attention (P3) and motor preparation (CNV)
4. Functional outcomes: Does σ or τ better predict real-world dual-tasking?
