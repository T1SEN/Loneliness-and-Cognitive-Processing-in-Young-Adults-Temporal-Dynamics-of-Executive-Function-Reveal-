Ex-Gaussian Decomposition Results:
==================================

Overall RT Components (N=157):
- μ (Gaussian mean): 631.3 ms (routine processing)
- σ (Gaussian SD): 187.0 ms (trial-to-trial variability)
- τ (Exponential tail): 415.2 ms (attentional lapses)

Key Question: Which component drives male UCLA → RT variability?

Findings:
---------

Significant UCLA × Gender Interactions Found:
  - τ (Exponential tail): β = 50.68, p = 0.0432

✅ FINDING: τ (Exponential tail) shows interaction
   → Male variability driven by ATTENTIONAL LAPSES
   → Suggests: Sustained attention failures under dual-task load


Cross-Reference to Previous Finding:
------------------------------------
- Previous analysis: Males show UCLA → T2 RT IQR (β = 76.98, p = 0.032*)
- Current analysis: Decomposes IQR into Ex-Gaussian components
- Interpretation depends on which parameter(s) show interaction

Theoretical Implications:
-------------------------
IF σ interaction: Males have inconsistent processing speed (reactive control failure)
IF τ interaction: Males have more attentional lapses (sustained attention failure)
IF BOTH: Males show dual deficit in speed consistency AND attention maintenance

Next Steps:
-----------
1. Trial-level mixed-effects models (more power than participant-level)
2. Larger sample size (current N=157 may be underpowered for Ex-Gaussian)
3. Neural correlates: EEG markers of attention (P3) and motor preparation (CNV)
4. Functional outcomes: Does σ or τ better predict real-world dual-tasking?
