MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE SUMMARY REPORT
======================================================================


UCLA Scale (20 items):
  1. Configural Invariance: Not Supported
  2. Metric Invariance: Supported (95.0% invariant)
  3. Scalar Invariance: Supported (90.0% invariant)
  4. Strict Invariance: Supported (95.0% invariant)
  → Highest supported level: Strict

DASS-21 Scale (21 items):
  1. Configural Invariance: Supported
  2. Metric Invariance: Supported (90.5% invariant)
  3. Scalar Invariance: Supported (95.2% invariant)
  4. Strict Invariance: Supported (95.2% invariant)
  → Highest supported level: Strict


Interpretation:
• Configural: Same factor structure across groups
• Metric: Same factor loadings (can compare relationships)
• Scalar: Same intercepts (can compare mean levels)
• Strict: Same residual variances (can compare reliability)
