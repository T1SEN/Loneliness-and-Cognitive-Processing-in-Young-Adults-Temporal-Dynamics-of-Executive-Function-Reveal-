COMPETING CAUSAL MODELS
========================

Model 1: Mood-Driven (DASS → EF, UCLA spurious)
  UCLA ← U → DASS → EF
  Implication: UCLA effect disappears when controlling DASS

Model 2: Full Mediation (UCLA → DASS → EF)
  UCLA → DASS → EF
  Implication: Direct effect = 0, only indirect effect remains

Model 3: Parallel Paths
  UCLA → EF
  UCLA → DASS → EF
  Implication: Both direct and indirect effects present

Model 4: Moderated Mediation
  UCLA → DASS → EF (paths moderated by Gender)
  Implication: Different effects for males vs females

EVIDENCE FROM THIS ANALYSIS:

WCST PE Rate:
  - Effect reduction with DASS control: 73.6%
  → Supports Model 2/3 (Partial Mediation)
  - Male ATE: -0.076, Female ATE: -0.234

PRP Bottleneck:
  - Effect reduction with DASS control: -75.9%
  → Supports Model 3 (Parallel Paths - direct effect remains)
  - Male ATE: 28.018, Female ATE: 13.245
  → Supports Model 4 (Gender Moderation)

WCST Accuracy:
  - Effect reduction with DASS control: 41.2%
  → Supports Model 3 (Parallel Paths - direct effect remains)
  - Male ATE: -0.420, Female ATE: 0.350
  → Supports Model 4 (Gender Moderation)
