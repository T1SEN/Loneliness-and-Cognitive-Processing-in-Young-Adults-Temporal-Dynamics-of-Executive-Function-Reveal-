DASS-21 MEDIATION ANALYSIS - SUMMARY REPORT
================================================================================

RESEARCH QUESTION:
Does DASS-21 (depression, anxiety, stress) mediate the relationship between
UCLA loneliness and executive function outcomes (especially HMM lapse recovery)?

================================================================================
METHODOLOGY
================================================================================
1. Baron & Kenny 4-step approach:
   - Step 1: Total effect (c path): Y ~ X
   - Step 2: a path: M ~ X
   - Step 3: Direct effect (c' path) + b path: Y ~ X + M
   - Step 4: Indirect effect (a×b) with Sobel test

2. Bootstrap confidence intervals (1000 iterations)
3. Covariates: Age, Gender

Sample size: 169 participants

INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

Mediation Types:
  - FULL MEDIATION: Total effect significant, direct effect NS, indirect significant
    → DASS-21 completely explains UCLA → Outcome relationship

  - PARTIAL MEDIATION: Total, direct, and indirect all significant
    → DASS-21 explains some but not all of UCLA effect

  - NO MEDIATION: Total effect significant, but indirect NS
    → UCLA effect is independent of DASS-21

Bootstrap CI Interpretation:
  - If CI excludes zero → Significant indirect effect
  - If CI includes zero → No mediation
