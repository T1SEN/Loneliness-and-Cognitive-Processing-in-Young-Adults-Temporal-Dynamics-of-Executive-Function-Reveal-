AGE × GENDER × UCLA THREE-WAY INTERACTION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

RESEARCH QUESTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is male UCLA→WCST_PE vulnerability age-dependent?
Hypothesis: Effect strongest in younger males (18-21), absent in older (22+)

KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. CONTINUOUS THREE-WAY INTERACTION
   UCLA × Gender × Age: p=0.0746
   ✗ NOT significant: Age does not significantly modulate the effect

2. MEDIAN-SPLIT AGE GROUPS
   Younger (N=34): UCLA×Gender β=0.3966, p=0.0254 [Yes]
   Older (N=38): UCLA×Gender β=0.0428, p=0.6438 [No]

3. AGE QUARTILE ANALYSIS
   ✓ Q1_Youngest (Age 18-19, N=34): β=0.3966, p=0.0254
   ✓ Q3 (Age 21-21, N=12): β=-0.6173, p=0.0033
   ✗ Q4_Oldest (Age 22-29, N=17): β=0.0327, p=0.8570

INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⚠️ Age moderation is present (or trending)
   Male vulnerability to loneliness→PE may be developmental
   Further investigation with larger sample recommended
