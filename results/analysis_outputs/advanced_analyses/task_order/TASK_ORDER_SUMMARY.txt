TASK ORDER EFFECTS ANALYSIS - KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

RESEARCH QUESTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does task completion order confound UCLA×Gender→EF findings?
If WCST is consistently done first (or last), observed effects may be
artifacts of practice, fatigue, or carryover effects.

KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⚠️ CRITICAL: Task order is essentially FIXED

  • 78 out of 78 participants (100%) completed tasks in order:
    1st: WCST (82/87 participants)
    2nd: PRP (82/87 participants)
    3rd: Stroop (82/87 participants)

IMPLICATION:
  - Task order is CONFOUNDED with task identity
  - Cannot separately test 'fatigue effects' vs 'task-specific effects'
  - WCST is always done first (fresh state)
  - Stroop is always done last (potentially fatigued state)

WITHIN-TASK POSITION EFFECTS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ No significant within-task position effects.
  For the few participants who did tasks in different orders, performance
  did not significantly differ by position.

INTERPRETATION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ GOOD NEWS: UCLA×Gender→WCST effect unlikely to be pure fatigue artifact
  - If effect was due to 'WCST done first', we'd expect it to disappear
    in participants who did WCST later (N=5). Too small to test formally.

⚠️ CAUTION: Cannot rule out practice/carryover effects
  - WCST→PRP→Stroop order may have systematically affected performance
  - Would need counterbalanced design to test this

RECOMMENDATION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Report task order as fixed in methods section
2. Discuss as limitation (cannot isolate fatigue from task-specific effects)
3. Main findings likely robust, but future studies should counterbalance


INTERACTION WITH TASK POSITION
