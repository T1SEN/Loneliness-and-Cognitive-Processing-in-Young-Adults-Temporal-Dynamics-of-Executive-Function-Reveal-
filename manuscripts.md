Loneliness and Evaluative Sensitivity: Temporal Dynamics of Cognitive Processing Costs in Young Adults
SeungHwan Jeong

Abstract
Loneliness is prevalent in emerging adulthood, yet its cognitive correlates in high-functioning young adults are difficult to detect when accuracy is near the ceiling. We tested whether loneliness is more sensitively captured by temporally resolved reaction-time (RT) dynamics that preserve within-task change.
Korean undergraduates (N = 212) completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale and DASS-21, then performed Stroop and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) tasks. Traditional outcomes were mean Stroop interference RT and WCST perseverative error rate. For process-specific indices, we examined whether interference costs accumulated as the Stroop task progressed, and whether WCST slowing was concentrated in uncertain phases when the sorting rule awaited confirmation.
Hierarchical regressions tested whether loneliness explained variance beyond age, gender, and emotional distress. Aggregate indices were null, whereas temporally resolved RT indices showed consistent loneliness effects in Stroop interference drift over time and in WCST confirmation-phase RTs. Trial-level mixed-effects models and alternative WCST phase thresholds produced convergent results.
These findings suggest that loneliness in young adults relates to when and under what task contexts processing costs emerge rather than to uniform performance deficits, and that temporally structured RT measures can reveal subtle individual differences missed by aggregate scores.

Significance Statement
In older adults, loneliness is an established risk factor for cognitive decline. Whether such associations are already detectable in young adulthood remains unclear.
Much of the research on loneliness and cognition in young adults has been guided by the hypervigilance hypothesis, focusing on attention to social threat cues—with mixed findings. General cognitive tasks have received comparatively less attention.
Such effects are difficult to detect in high-functioning samples where accuracy is near the ceiling. Moreover, traditional summary scores collapse performance into a single number, obscuring when and how difficulties emerge.
A key principle follows: if effects are dynamic rather than uniform, measurement must preserve temporal structure rather than averaging behavior into one score.
We propose that loneliness-related costs are not uniform deficits. Instead, they may emerge selectively depending on task context—even in laboratory tasks with no explicit social content.
In two executive function tasks, tracking how performance changed within the task revealed loneliness-related patterns invisible to traditional summary scores.
These findings suggest that detecting loneliness-cognition associations in young adults may require preserving how performance unfolds over time, rather than relying on summary scores. This framework suggests testable predictions about when cognitive costs emerge.
1. Introduction
Background
Emerging adulthood is a period of heightened vulnerability to loneliness (Kirwan et al., 2024), yet research on its cognitive correlates in this age group remains limited. Most loneliness–cognition research has targeted older adults, where links to cognitive decline and dementia are well established (Luchetti et al., 2024; Wilson et al., 2007). Whether similar associations are already detectable in young adulthood—when cognitive performance is relatively efficient—is an open question.
Young adulthood is a theoretically important period for examining loneliness–cognition relationships. Frontal systems supporting cognitive control continue to mature into early adulthood, and cognitive performance is relatively stable across many domains during this period (Sowell et al., 2003; Luna et al., 2010; Hartshorne & Germine, 2015; Forte et al., 2024). If loneliness is associated with measurable cognitive differences even under these relatively optimal developmental conditions, this would suggest that such differences can be detected early and may warrant investigation as potential contributors to longer-term trajectories.
Jin and Hwang (2024) provided preliminary evidence that loneliness in young adults is associated with poorer executive functioning, with effects persisting after controlling for depression and anxiety. However, their findings were based on a small sample (N = 54) and were not explicitly grounded in a broader mechanistic account, highlighting the need for replication in larger samples and for theory-driven approaches that specify when and how loneliness should affect cognitive processing.

The Hypervigilance Hypothesis
Much of the research on loneliness and cognition in young adults has been motivated by Cacioppo and Hawkley's (2009, 2010) hypervigilance hypothesis, which proposes that chronic loneliness triggers heightened vigilance for social threat. As summarized by Spithoven et al. (2017), empirical findings have been mixed.
Studies using emotional Stroop paradigms have yielded inconsistent results. Some report loneliness-related interference for negative social stimuli (Cacioppo et al., 2015; Shin & Kim, 2019), whereas a recent individual-participant meta-analysis found no support for this pattern across multiple samples (Restrepo et al., 2025).
Eye-tracking research presents a similarly mixed picture: some studies report early vigilance to rejection cues only at high loneliness levels (Bangee et al., 2014; Bangee & Qualter, 2018), while others find no attentional differences (Lodder et al., 2015).
Neurophysiological work adds further complexity. Cacioppo et al. (2015) reported EEG evidence of earlier differentiation of negative social stimuli in lonelier individuals, even without corresponding behavioral differences—suggesting that standard behavioral indices may underestimate subtle processing differences. Large-scale neuroimaging links loneliness to altered resting-state connectivity in frontal systems implicated in cognitive control (Brilliant et al., 2022), indicating that loneliness may be reflected in neural measures even when behavioral effects are small or absent.
Hypervigilance-based research focusing on social threat cue processing presents an inconsistent picture. Positive effects have emerged primarily at extreme loneliness levels or with specific stimulus types, while many studies report null findings. This inconsistency may reflect limitations inherent in focusing on social threat processing as the primary outcome—raising the possibility that the cognitive signature of loneliness lies not in a specific bias toward social stimuli, but in more fundamental alterations in how evaluative contexts are processed.
From Social Threat to Evaluative Sensitivity: Temporal Dynamics as a Sensitive Index
The findings reviewed above present a puzzle. Jin and Hwang's (2024) preliminary evidence suggests that loneliness is associated with poorer performance on domain-general executive function tasks with no explicit social content. Yet research guided by the hypervigilance hypothesis—which directly examines social cue processing—has yielded inconsistent results. Why should loneliness, often conceptualized as a social-relational deficit, affect performance on nonsocial cognitive tasks when its effects on social information processing remain equivocal?
This pattern permits two interpretations: either the two research streams reflect distinct mechanisms, or a more encompassing theoretical framework can integrate both sets of findings. We pursue the latter possibility.

The hypervigilance hypothesis posits that lonely individuals maintain implicit vigilance for potential social threat, especially cues of evaluation or rejection (Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2010). We propose that this vigilance may generalize to any context in which one's performance is being assessed.
Laboratory-based cognitive tasks are inherently evaluative: performance is measured, feedback is often provided, and participants are aware that their abilities are being scrutinized. In this sense, an "evaluative context" includes the possibility of unfavorable performance feedback (and, in social tasks, cues that resemble rejection), even when no explicit social interaction is present. From this perspective, a lonely individual may approach a laboratory cognitive task not merely as a cognitive challenge, but as an evaluative situation where competence is implicitly judged.
From this perspective, loneliness-related effects may be detectable in general cognitive tasks, which provide a relatively uniform evaluative context in which performance is explicitly measured. If lonely individuals are characterized by heightened sensitivity to evaluative contexts generally, rather than to social threat specifically, effects may also emerge in social cue paradigms; however, evaluative pressure may be weaker or more variable in these paradigms, and static stimuli (e.g., threat-related words or pictures) can vary considerably in their evaluative potency (e.g., perceived rejection or criticism) across individuals and paradigms.
If evaluative sensitivity is the operative mechanism, its effects are unlikely to appear as a uniform deficit in aggregate performance. Rather, evaluative sensitivity should manifest dynamically: its costs may accumulate as evaluative pressure is sustained (e.g., progressive slowing) or peak during moments of heightened evaluative salience (e.g., when outcomes are uncertain).
Capturing such temporal dynamics naturally requires reaction time (RT), because RT preserves trial-by-trial variability and within-task change that are lost when performance is collapsed into a single summary score. Moreover, in high-functioning young adult samples, accuracy is often near ceiling, limiting the sensitivity of accuracy-based indices (Wang et al., 2009). RT, by contrast, provides continuous distributional information even when accuracy is uniformly high (Balota & Yap, 2011; Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008), allowing subtle processing costs that would be missed by accuracy or mean-level indices to be detected.
Operationalizing Temporal Dynamics
To test the evaluative sensitivity framework, we focused on process-specific RT indices—measures that capture dynamic changes in reaction time across a task, rather than static average performance. Guided by this framework, we examined two complementary dimensions of temporal dynamics that may reflect different aspects of evaluative sensitivity.
The first concerns drift over time on task. Sustained attention research shows that performance often declines with prolonged engagement, reflecting gradual depletion of cognitive resources (Hockey, 1997; Warm et al., 2008). From an evaluative sensitivity perspective, lonely individuals may experience accelerated resource depletion because, in addition to core task demands, they continuously allocate resources to monitoring performance and anticipating negative evaluative feedback. We therefore predicted that higher loneliness would be associated with greater performance decline (slowing RT drift) over time.
The second concerns processing efficiency across evaluative contexts. If loneliness heightens sensitivity to evaluative uncertainty, processing costs should be most pronounced during uncertain task phases (where outcomes await confirmation) compared to established phases (where performance is predictable). We predicted that loneliness would be associated with larger RT differences between these contexts, reflecting specific difficulty during evaluatively ambiguous moments.
The Present Study
The present study had two aims. First, using a larger sample than Jin and Hwang (2024), we sought to replicate and more precisely estimate loneliness–executive function associations in young adults. Second, we evaluated whether temporally sensitive, process-specific RT indices capture loneliness-related differences more effectively than traditional aggregate indices on two executive function tasks (Stroop and WCST). We expected process-specific indices to be more sensitive than aggregate indices. Detailed measurement procedures are described in the Method section.
Building on Jin and Hwang (2024), which examined loneliness using the Stroop task and the WCST, we used these tasks to test whether different task architectures yield distinct temporal signatures, as predicted by the evaluative sensitivity account. The Stroop task imposes sustained, repetitive demand, making it well suited to detecting cumulative costs that would be consistent with resource depletion (i.e., time-on-task drift). In contrast, the WCST involves repeated cycles of hypothesis testing and feedback, allowing us to isolate moments of evaluative uncertainty (e.g., rule confirmation) versus established performance.
Guided by these aims, we tested two hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1. Higher loneliness would be associated with a more pronounced increase in interference cost over time on the Stroop task (positive RT slope), consistent with accelerated depletion of cognitive resources under sustained evaluative engagement.
Hypothesis 2. Higher loneliness would be associated with a larger RT cost during the uncertain confirmation phase relative to the established exploitation phase on the WCST, consistent with heightened processing sensitivity during moments of evaluative ambiguity.
2. Method
Participants
Participants were recruited from an initial pool of 251 undergraduate students residing in Gwangju, Korea, via the Chonnam National University Research Participant Pool (students enrolled in psychology courses). Inclusion criteria were age 19 to 29 years, native Korean proficiency, and access to a desktop or laptop computer. Exclusion criteria were self reported current psychiatric or neurological treatment, color vision deficiency, and mobile device participation.
After quality control procedures (described in Section 2.4), final analytic samples were N = 220 for the Stroop task and N = 212 for the WCST. Samples overlapped substantially; N = 209 participants provided valid data for both tasks. Among participants with complete survey and task data, mean age was 20.40 years (SD = 3.48) and 39% were male.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chonnam National University (IRB No. 1040198-250528-HR-112-03). All participants provided electronic informed consent prior to participation. Identifying information was stored separately from research data and deleted after course credit disbursement in accordance with institutional guidelines.
2.2 Measures
2.2.1 Self Report Instruments
UCLA Loneliness Scale (Version 3; Russell, 1996).
Loneliness was assessed using a validated Korean translation of the 20 item UCLA Loneliness Scale Version 3 (Jin & Hwang, 2019). Items were rated on a 4 point scale (1 = never to 4 = often). After reverse coding positively worded items, responses were summed to yield total scores ranging from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater loneliness. Internal consistency in the present sample was excellent (α = .94).
Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS 21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995).
Emotional distress was measured using a validated Korean translation of the DASS 21 (Lee et al., 2019). The scale yields three 7 item subscales (Depression, Anxiety, Stress), each rated on a 4 point scale (0 to 3) with reference to the past week. Subscale sums were multiplied by 2 to obtain DASS 42 equivalent scores, consistent with the scoring manual. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent (αs = .78 to .92).
2.2.2 Cognitive Tasks
Stroop Task.
A computerized color word Stroop task assessed interference control. Participants identified the ink color of presented words using four on screen response buttons corresponding to red, blue, green, and yellow. The task included three conditions: congruent (e.g., "RED" in red ink), incongruent (e.g., "RED" in blue ink), and neutral (e.g., "XXXX" in red ink), with 36 trials per condition (108 trials total), presented in randomized order within blocks.
Each trial presented a fixation cross (500 ms), a brief blank interval (100 ms), and a stimulus displayed until response or timeout (3,000 ms). Practice trials (12 trials) with accuracy feedback preceded the main task; no feedback was provided during the main block.
Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST).
A computerized 128 card WCST assessed cognitive flexibility and set shifting (Heaton et al., 1993). On each trial, participants sorted a stimulus card to one of four reference cards according to an unstated rule (color, shape, or number). The sorting rule changed without explicit notification after 10 consecutive correct responses, following a fixed sequence (color, then shape, then number, repeating).
The task ended when either six categories were completed or all 128 trials were exhausted. Feedback ("Correct" or "Incorrect") was provided after each response.
2.3 Procedure
Participants completed the experiment remotely using their own desktop or laptop computers via a custom web application built with Flutter. The application was restricted to desktop devices to ensure adequate screen size and input precision. Reaction times were recorded with millisecond level precision.
After providing electronic consent, participants completed demographic questions (age, gender), followed by self report measures (UCLA Loneliness Scale, then DASS 21).
All participants completed the Stroop task first, followed by the WCST. A mandatory 2 minute rest interval was inserted between tasks to minimize carryover effects. The session lasted approximately 30 minutes.
2.4 Data Analysis
1. Preprocessing(stroop+wcst, n=212)
Participant level exclusions.
For the Stroop task, participants were retained if they completed all 108 trials with overall accuracy ≥ 70% (timeouts coded as incorrect).
For the WCST, participants were retained if at least 60 valid trials remained after exclusions and no single reference card was selected on more than 85% of trials (indicating random or perseverative response unrelated to the task).
Trial level exclusions.
For both tasks, trials with reaction times < 200 ms were flagged as anticipatory responses and excluded from RT based analyses.
For the Stroop task, RT based analyses used trials with RTs between 200 and 3,000 ms.
For the WCST, RT based analyses used trials with RTs between 200 and 10,000 ms to accommodate the more complex decision processes involved in card sorting.
Full exclusion criteria, exclusion rates, and sample flow are reported in the Supplementary Materials.
2.4.2 Outcome Variables
Stroop task.
For the traditional index, Interference RT was computed as mean RT on incongruent trials minus mean RT on congruent trials (correct trials only). Larger values indicate greater interference.
For the process-specific index, we examined time-on-task drift in interference effects.
Trials were partitioned into four sequential quartiles based on global trial order (1–108), a common approach in time-on-task research (Helton & Russell, 2015). Continuous trial-level analysis confirmed the robustness of this segmentation (see Supplementary Analyses). Within each segment, condition-specific mean RTs were computed using correct trials only.
Interference RT slope was computed as the OLS regression slope of segment-wise interference effects (incongruent RT minus congruent RT) over segment order (1–4). Positive slopes indicate progressive increase in interference cost; negative slopes indicate attenuation of interference with practice.
WCST.
For the traditional index, perseverative error rate was computed as the percentage of trials reflecting perseveration to a previously correct rule (Heaton et al., 1993).
For the process-specific index, we examined processing costs across different task contexts within each category.
Unlike the Stroop task, where performance can be tracked as a continuous function of trial order, the WCST's category structure creates cyclical performance patterns—RT typically decreases within each category as the rule is acquired, then resets when the rule changes.
Global time-on-task analysis (i.e., across categories) was therefore inappropriate: learning effects (task familiarization) and fatigue effects (sustained demand) operate in opposing directions and are confounded when tracking RT across the full task.
We instead focused on within-category dynamics, partitioning trials within each completed category into distinct processing phases.
Prior research has employed various approaches to segment WCST performance temporally, including early versus late trial comparisons (Barceló et al., 1997), event-related separation of feedback processing stages (Monchi et al., 2001), and rule search versus rule application distinctions based on cardiac dynamics (Somsen et al., 2000).
In the present study, we defined phase boundaries using the onset of three consecutive correct responses—a threshold consistent with WCST Conceptual Level Response scoring conventions, which treat runs of three or more correct responses as evidence of rule acquisition (Heaton et al., 1993).
To examine where loneliness-related processing costs might emerge, we further subdivided the pre-acquisition period into exploration (category onset until first correct response) and confirmation (first correct response until three consecutive correct), yielding a three-phase framework: exploration, confirmation, and exploitation.
Mean RT was computed separately for each phase, aggregated across categories to yield participant-level indices. Analyses included all valid trials (correct and incorrect) with RTs between 200 and 10,000 ms.
Including error trials was necessary because exploration and confirmation phases are characterized by trial-and-error responding; restriction to correct trials would systematically underrepresent these phases and reduce measurement stability.
Split-half reliability was assessed using an odd-even approach rather than first-half versus second-half partitioning, because within-category learning effects would confound temporal splits.
Reliability estimates are reported alongside descriptive statistics in the Results section. The primary contrast of interest was confirmation versus exploitation RT, operationalizing the comparison between uncertain and established task contexts specified in Hypothesis 2.
2.4.3 Statistical Approach
Analyses were conducted separately for each task using task-specific samples. The primary aim was to compare traditional aggregate indices and process-specific RT indices for detecting loneliness-related associations.
Measurement sensitivity was evaluated comparatively based on the magnitude and significance of loneliness effects (unstandardized coefficients and ΔR²) across index types within each task.
Hierarchical multiple regression models were estimated in three steps: Step 1: Demographics (age, gender); Step 2: Emotional distress (DASS 21 Depression, Anxiety, Stress subscales); Step 3: Loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale total score).
The incremental contribution of loneliness was quantified as ΔR² at Step 3, representing variance uniquely explained by loneliness after accounting for demographics and emotional distress.
Given that loneliness typically shares substantial variance with emotional distress, multicollinearity diagnostics were conducted; variance inflation factors are reported in Section 3.2.
Multiple comparisons.
Given the hypothesis-driven focus on the three process-specific primary outcomes specified in Hypotheses 1–2 (Stroop interference RT slope; WCST confirmation RT; WCST confirmation–exploitation contrast), we applied a Bonferroni correction across these primary tests (α = .05/3). Other indices reported for completeness (Stroop mean interference RT; WCST perseverative error rate; WCST exploitation RT) were treated as exploratory and were not subjected to additional correction.
3. Results
3.1 Descriptive Statistics
Participant Characteristics.
Of the 223 participants who completed the study surveys, 212 completed both the Stroop task and the WCST. Analyses were restricted to this common sample to enable comparison across tasks. The sample had a mean age of 20.38 years (SD = 3.37) and was 38.7% male.
Self-Report Measures.
UCLA Loneliness scores averaged 40.63 (SD = 11.11). DASS-21 subscale means were within nonclinical ranges: Depression (M = 7.63, SD = 7.98), Anxiety (M = 5.61, SD = 5.92), and Stress (M = 10.10, SD = 7.66).
Task Performance.
Both tasks produced expected effects. The Stroop task yielded a robust interference effect (M = 138.03 ms), t(211) = 20.01, p < .001. The WCST showed normative performance; 91.0% of participants completed all six categories (M = 5.77, SD = 0.83).
3.2 Correlations
In the common sample (N = 212), loneliness was strongly correlated with all DASS-21 subscales: Depression (r = .663, p < .001), Anxiety (r = .497, p < .001), and Stress (r = .550, p < .001). This substantial shared variance motivated controlling for emotional distress in subsequent regression analyses.
Multicollinearity diagnostics indicated acceptable variance inflation factors (max VIF = 2.68, mean VIF = 1.96).
For traditional indices, loneliness showed no significant zero-order correlations with Stroop interference RT (r = .013, p = .846) or WCST perseverative error rate (r = −.113, p = .102).
For process-specific indices, loneliness was significantly correlated with Stroop interference RT slope (r = .223, p = .001), WCST confirmation RT (r = .194, p = .005), and the confirmation–exploitation difference (r = .182, p = .008). Exploitation RT was not significantly correlated with loneliness (r = .083, p = .230).

3.3 Primary Regression Analyses
Hierarchical regression models were estimated for each outcome variable. Predictors were entered in three steps: Step 1 (age, gender), Step 2 (DASS-21 Depression, Anxiety, Stress), and Step 3 (UCLA Loneliness). The incremental contribution of loneliness was quantified as ΔR² at Step 3.
3.3.1 Stroop Task
After controlling for demographics and emotional distress, loneliness did not significantly predict interference RT (b = 5.94, SE = 9.48, p = .532, ΔR² = .002).
In contrast, loneliness significantly predicted time-on-task drift in interference (b = 18.23, SE = 5.65, p = .001, ΔR² = .047). Given that the sample-wide mean interference slope was near zero (M = −0.13), this positive coefficient indicates that higher loneliness was associated with increasing interference cost over time—greater difficulty maintaining efficient inhibitory control under sustained demand.

3.3.2 WCST
Loneliness did not significantly predict perseverative error rate (b = −0.17, SE = 0.58, p = .775, ΔR² < .001).
For process-specific indices, loneliness significantly predicted confirmation RT (b = 145.95, SE = 47.40, p = .002, ΔR² = .043), indicating prolonged response times during the rule verification phase.
Exploitation RT was not significant (b = −2.64, SE = 31.65, p = .934, ΔR² < .001).
The confirmation–exploitation difference was also significant (b = 148.59, SE = 36.07, p < .001, ΔR² = .077): higher loneliness was associated with a larger RT reduction from confirmation to exploitation, indicating greater processing cost disparity between uncertain and established task contexts.

3.4 Supplementary Analyses
Continuous trial-level analysis (Stroop).
To verify that the four-segment partitioning did not artificially constrain the time-on-task findings, we conducted a linear mixed-effects model treating trial position as a continuous predictor. Using data from 212 participants (14,986 trials), the model predicted log-transformed RT as a function of trial position (scaled 0 to 1 within participants), condition (congruent = −0.5, incongruent = 0.5), loneliness (z-scored), all two- and three-way interactions, and covariates, with random intercepts and random slopes for trial position.
The critical three-way interaction (Trial × Condition × Loneliness) was significant (b = 0.051, SE = 0.016, z = 3.14, p = .002), confirming that higher loneliness was associated with steeper increases in the interference effect over time.
This convergence between segment-based and continuous approaches supports the robustness of the observed pattern.
Two-phase analysis (WCST).
Given that the exploration phase showed insufficient reliability, we conducted a supplementary two-phase analysis combining exploration and confirmation into a single pre-exploitation phase. This approach also aligns with Somsen et al.'s (2000) rule search versus rule application framework.
Loneliness significantly predicted pre-exploitation RT (b = 141.68, SE = 46.77, p = .003, ΔR² = .042), but not exploitation RT (b = 25.65, SE = 35.45, p = .470, ΔR² = .002).
The pre-exploitation versus exploitation difference was also significant (b = 116.03, SE = 37.24, p = .002, ΔR² = .045).
This pattern is consistent with the three-phase results, though the three-phase framework provides more precise localization of effects to the confirmation phase specifically.
Threshold sensitivity analysis (WCST).
The primary analyses defined the confirmation–exploitation boundary at three consecutive correct responses, consistent with WCST Conceptual Level Response conventions (Heaton et al., 1993).
To assess whether results depended on this specific threshold, we re-estimated the phase-based models using alternative criteria (two and four consecutive correct responses) in the phase-complete sample (N = 209). Results were consistent across thresholds: loneliness significantly predicted confirmation RT and the confirmation–exploitation difference regardless of criterion, whereas exploitation RT remained nonsignificant.
4. Discussion
4.1 Summary of Findings
The present study examined whether loneliness in young adults is associated with specific temporal dynamics of cognitive processing on executive function tasks, as predicted by the evaluative sensitivity framework. Results supported both hypotheses.
Hypothesis 1 (Sustained Pressure and Resource Depletion) was supported: loneliness significantly predicted Stroop interference RT slope (ΔR² = .047, p = .001), indicating that lonelier individuals showed a more pronounced increase in interference costs over the course of the task. This pattern is consistent with accelerated resource depletion under sustained evaluative engagement.
Hypothesis 2 (Evaluative Uncertainty and Context Sensitivity) was also supported: loneliness predicted WCST confirmation RT (ΔR² = .043, p = .002) and the confirmation–exploitation contrast (ΔR² = .077, p < .001), but not exploitation RT. This pattern indicates that loneliness-related processing costs were specific to the uncertain rule verification phase, consistent with heightened sensitivity to evaluative ambiguity.
In contrast, traditional aggregate indices showed no significant loneliness associations after controlling for emotional distress (Stroop interference RT: ΔR² = .002, p = .532; WCST perseverative error rate: ΔR² < .001, p = .775). This divergence suggests that loneliness relates to how cognitive processing unfolds over time and across task contexts—dimensions that aggregate measures do not preserve.
These effects were robust across analytic specifications (segment-based vs. continuous trial-level models; alternative WCST thresholds) and convergent across tasks.
4.2 Theoretical Implications
The present findings are broadly consistent with the evaluative sensitivity framework proposed in the Introduction: loneliness may be linked to heightened reactivity in situations where performance is assessed. Here, evaluative sensitivity is used as an interpretive framework rather than a confirmed mechanism.
Conceptually, this framework can be viewed as a natural extension of Hawkley and Cacioppo's (2010) hypervigilance account. If loneliness heightens vigilance for evaluation and rejection in social contexts, similar monitoring processes may be engaged by nonsocial tasks that nonetheless carry evaluative meaning (e.g., timed responding and performance feedback).
Our results suggest that loneliness-related differences were not well captured by static, aggregate indices, but instead emerged as temporally structured processing costs that depended on task architecture.
On the Stroop task, loneliness was unrelated to mean interference RT but predicted a progressive increase in interference cost over time (a more positive interference RT slope), suggesting increasing difficulty sustaining efficient inhibitory control across the task.
On the WCST, loneliness predicted selective slowing during the confirmation phase, when a plausible rule hypothesis awaits external validation, but not during exploitation once the rule was established. This phase-specific pattern suggests that processing costs may be most apparent when internal confidence and external feedback are tightly coupled.
Together, these findings suggest that the cognitive correlate of loneliness in high-functioning young adults may be better characterized as context-dependent fragility in processing efficiency rather than a uniform performance deficit. These interpretations are necessarily tentative and should be understood as a candidate framework rather than a confirmed mechanism. Critically, evaluative sensitivity was neither directly measured (e.g., via post-task ratings of perceived evaluation, perceived performance pressure, or performance anxiety) nor experimentally manipulated (e.g., by varying feedback salience, incentives, or social observation). The present data therefore cannot definitively distinguish whether the observed temporal patterns reflect evaluative sensitivity specifically, or other processes such as general response caution, fatigue, vigilance decrement, or reduced task engagement. Future work that experimentally varies evaluative pressure and incorporates independent measures of monitoring/effort and strategy (e.g., confidence ratings, speed–accuracy emphasis, pupillometry) will be important for testing whether evaluative sensitivity is the operative pathway.
4.3 Relationship to Previous Research
Relation to Jin and Hwang (2024).
Although the present study was designed in part as a replication/extension of Jin and Hwang (2024), our results did not fully mirror theirs. Rather than framing this as a strict replication, we interpret the differences as reflecting the greater sensitivity of temporally resolved indices relative to aggregate measures.
First, the structure of Jin and Hwang's protocol may have contributed to when effects became detectable. Their study administered multiple neurocognitive tasks consecutively, which may allow evaluative and self-monitoring costs to accumulate across tasks; under this view, loneliness-related differences may be more likely to emerge downstream (e.g., as later accuracy deficits) than in early-task performance.
Second, the effective samples may not be directly comparable. Jin and Hwang reported evidence consistent with selective noncompletion among the most severely lonely participants, implying that the tested high-loneliness group may have been attenuated relative to the recruitment pool. Our online protocol analyzed the full loneliness distribution without that specific attrition pattern, which may improve coverage of higher loneliness levels.
These interpretations are offered as hypotheses rather than established explanations. We did not directly measure evaluative sensitivity or reasons for noncompletion, and alternative accounts remain plausible.
4.4 Methodological Implications
Traditional aggregate indices (e.g., mean RT and accuracy) can be insensitive in high-functioning samples, where accuracy approaches ceiling and averaging obscures within-task change. The present findings illustrate this limitation directly: loneliness was not detected using aggregate indices but was detectable using temporally structured, process-specific RT measures. More generally, when theory predicts time-varying or context-dependent processing costs, measurement approaches that preserve temporal information are required.
The present study operationalized temporally sensitive measurement in a task-appropriate manner. For the Stroop task, we focused on time-on-task drift in interference (interference RT slope), capturing cumulative change under sustained demand. For the WCST, we focused on phase-specific RTs, contrasting confirmation versus exploitation to isolate processing costs during evaluatively ambiguous versus established task contexts. This approach highlights a key methodological advantage: the same underlying construct (executive control) may yield different temporal signatures depending on task architecture, and these signatures can be targeted with process-specific indices.
The web-based implementation further supports the feasibility of this approach. Online assessment enables scalable data collection, reduces costs relative to laboratory-intensive methods, and can provide millisecond-level RT precision comparable to laboratory standards (Bridges et al., 2020; Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2021). For future loneliness–cognition research in young adults, we recommend preserving trial-level data, explicitly modeling temporal variables (e.g., trial order, task phase) as predictors of interest, and reporting both aggregate and process-specific indices to clarify when temporal dynamics offer incremental sensitivity.
4.5 Limitations and Future Directions
Several limitations warrant consideration when interpreting these findings.
Interpretive limitations and alternative accounts
Causality.
The cross-sectional design precludes causal inference; although we have framed loneliness as associated with elevated processing costs, the direction of causation remains undetermined. Bidirectionality (loneliness may increase processing costs, and/or pre-existing processing inefficiency may increase loneliness) and third-variable explanations (unmeasured factors may contribute to both loneliness and processing inefficiency) are both consistent with our data.
Longitudinal designs and experimental manipulations are necessary to establish temporal precedence and evaluate causal pathways.
Covariate control and potential overcontrol.
Because loneliness was substantially correlated with emotional distress (Depression r = .663, Anxiety r = .497, Stress r = .550), controlling for DASS-21 scores requires careful interpretation.
If distress partially mediates rather than confounds the loneliness–cognition association, our control may represent statistical overcontrol.
We therefore describe effects as loneliness-related variance "beyond shared variance with emotional distress," not as evidence for purely loneliness-specific mechanisms.
Lack of direct mechanism assessment.
Evaluative sensitivity was proposed as an organizing framework for the observed temporal signatures, but it was not directly assessed in this study. We did not include manipulation checks (e.g., perceived evaluative burden or performance anxiety) or experimentally vary evaluative pressure (e.g., feedback salience, incentives, or social observation). Accordingly, the present results should not be interpreted as establishing evaluative sensitivity as the operative mechanism.
Alternative mechanisms.
We interpreted our findings through the lens of evaluative sensitivity and resource depletion, but several nonexclusive alternatives could contribute to similar temporal signatures.
Strategic account (response caution). Lonelier participants may have adopted a more cautious response style, producing higher RTs when feedback was consequential (e.g., WCST confirmation). This account predicts that effects should track indices of response caution rather than effort/monitoring per se. Future work can evaluate this possibility by adding confidence ratings and modeling response caution, or by experimentally manipulating speed–accuracy emphasis.
Motivational account (task engagement). Subtle differences in engagement or persistence could also contribute to slowing over time. However, generalized disengagement would be expected to affect multiple phases, whereas the present WCST effects were concentrated in confirmation rather than exploitation. This account can be tested by incorporating independent engagement measures and by examining whether effects remain phase-specific under matched incentives.
Sleep-related account. Finally, chronic sleep problems associated with loneliness (Griffin et al., 2019) may contribute to reduced sustained attention and increased RT variability (Lim & Dinges, 2010), potentially mimicking time-on-task drift effects. Future studies should therefore include validated sleep measures (and, where feasible, objective indices) to quantify this pathway and assess whether sleep attenuates the loneliness–RT associations.
Methodological limitations
Sample representativeness and selection bias.
Our sample may underrepresent individuals for whom the proposed mechanism is strongest. Jin and Hwang (2024) documented that the most severely lonely individuals were less likely to complete neurocognitive testing.
This pattern is consistent with the evaluative sensitivity framework itself: if highly lonely individuals perceive research participation—with its inherent performance evaluation—as more threatening, they may opt out.
Measurement and analytic considerations.
Online testing may introduce environmental noise (e.g., distractions and device variability), though such noise would be expected to attenuate rather than inflate associations.
Finally, the WCST exploration phase showed insufficient reliability, limiting inferences about loneliness-related costs during initial rule search. However, supplementary two-phase analyses combining exploration and confirmation into a single pre-exploitation phase yielded a similar pattern of results, suggesting that the core effect is robust to this alternative phase specification.
Effect sizes.
The observed effects (ΔR² ≈ .04–.05; r ≈ .20–.23) are small but consistent with norms in individual differences research (Gignac & Szodorai, 2016; Funder & Ozer, 2019). Importantly, they reached conventional significance despite conservative conditions (a high-functioning sample, stringent data quality procedures, and comprehensive distress control), underscoring the value of temporally sensitive RT indices for detecting subtle loneliness–cognition associations.
Future directions
To advance the evaluative sensitivity framework, future work should clarify temporal ordering, test mechanism specificity, and broaden measurement.
Establish temporal precedence. Longitudinal designs and/or intensive repeated-measures approaches are needed to determine whether loneliness prospectively predicts increases in process-specific RT costs, whether cognitive inefficiency precedes loneliness, or whether both change together over time.
Directly test the mechanism. Experimental manipulations of evaluative threat (e.g., feedback salience, social observation) can test whether loneliness-related slowing is selectively amplified under evaluative pressure and whether effects concentrate in uncertain task phases (e.g., WCST confirmation) as predicted.
Add converging indicators of monitoring and effort. Incorporating physiological and metacognitive measures (e.g., pupillometry, heart rate variability, confidence ratings) would help distinguish compensatory effort/monitoring from strategic response caution.
Reduce evaluative pressure and test malleability. Minimally evaluative assessment approaches (e.g., gamified tasks, ecological momentary assessment) may reduce participation barriers and improve ecological validity; intervention studies can then test whether reducing loneliness improves process-specific indices.
4.6 Conclusion
The present study provides evidence that loneliness in young adults is associated with specific temporal patterns of cognitive processing costs—a dimension of individual differences revealed only when measurement captures temporal dynamics.
After controlling for depression, anxiety, and stress, loneliness predicted (1) time-on-task drift toward increasing interference on the Stroop task and (2) prolonged response times specifically during the uncertain confirmation phase of the WCST.
These small but convergent effects across distinct executive tasks lend initial support to the evaluative sensitivity framework, which posits that loneliness is linked to heightened reactivity to evaluative contexts.
These findings carry dual implications. Methodologically, they illustrate that loneliness-related differences may be difficult to detect with static aggregate indices in high-functioning samples, and that analyses preserving within-task temporal structure can reveal otherwise subtle processing costs.
Theoretically, they are consistent with evaluative sensitivity as a candidate mechanism linking loneliness to cognition, in that costs emerged under sustained demand and during uncertain, feedback-dependent task phases.
The persistence of these effects after stringent control for emotional distress suggests that social disconnection may relate to cognition through pathways at least partially distinct from co-occurring depression and anxiety. However, the cross-sectional design precludes causal claims.
Future longitudinal and experimental research is needed to establish directionality and to test mechanism specificity by experimentally manipulating evaluative pressure (e.g., feedback salience, incentives, social observation) and incorporating converging measures of perceived evaluative burden and response strategy (e.g., confidence ratings, speed–accuracy emphasis/caution), to distinguish evaluative sensitivity from alternative accounts such as generalized fatigue, vigilance decrement, or strategic response caution.
