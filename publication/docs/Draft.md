## Stroop trial-level mixed-effects check (interference slope)

We fit a trial-level mixed-effects model targeting the interference slope using congruent/incongruent trials only, condition coded as -0.5 (congruent) / +0.5 (incongruent), and a continuous within-participant trial position (trial_scaled, 0-1). RT was log-transformed; DASS subscales, age, and gender were controlled. The random-effects structure was simplified to random intercepts plus random trial_scaled slopes due to boundary warnings in the richer structure. The trial_scaled x condition x UCLA interaction (interference slope moderation) was significant (beta = 0.0580, SE = 0.0167, z = 3.469, p = 0.000522; n_trials = 13,950; n_participants = 197), while the average trial_scaled x condition slope at mean UCLA was not significant (beta = 0.0078, SE = 0.0166, p = 0.637). The richer random-effects structure (1 + trial_scaled + cond_code) yielded a similar estimate (beta = 0.0578, SE = 0.0166, p = 0.000508). An lme4 cross-check reproduced the effect (beta = 0.0580, SE = 0.0167, p = 0.000523). The participant-level quartile interference slope remained significant in the standard OLS model (beta = 19.033, SE = 6.009, p = 0.00179; n = 197).

## WCST phase-based trial-level mixed-effects models

WCST trials were labeled by phase using rule changes and the first three consecutive correct responses per category: exploration (rule change to first correct run), confirmation (three correct trials), and exploitation (post-reacquisition to category end). Analyses used RT-valid trials (200–10,000 ms), log-transformed RTs, and QC-passed participants (n_participants = 197; n_trials = 17,214). Phase counts were: exploration = 3,409; confirmation = 3,417; exploitation = 10,388. Random effects used a numeric phase_code slope (1 + phase_code | participant).

Model 1 (base): log_rt ~ C(phase, Treatment('exploitation')) * z_ucla_score + post_error_code * z_ucla_score + DASS + age + gender, with post_error defined as the trial immediately following any error. Exploration and confirmation were slower than exploitation (exploration beta = 0.188, p = 4.24e-35; confirmation beta = 0.188, p = 2.89e-62). Phase x UCLA effects were not significant for exploration (beta = 0.0183, p = 0.231) and marginal for confirmation (beta = 0.0221, p = 0.052). The overall UCLA effect at exploitation was not significant (beta = 0.0190, p = 0.338). Post-error slowing was robust (post_error beta = 0.295, p < 1e-200) and the post_error x UCLA interaction was negative (beta = -0.0181, p = 0.035).

Model 2 (extended): added category_num and C(rule). Results were similar: exploration x UCLA (beta = 0.0176, p = 0.217), confirmation x UCLA (beta = 0.0217, p = 0.053), and exploitation UCLA (beta = 0.0192, p = 0.329). The post_error x UCLA effect remained negative (beta = -0.0180, p = 0.033). Category_num showed a strong negative slope (beta = -0.0486, p = 1.0e-115), indicating faster RTs in later categories.

Phase-specific LMMs (fit separately within each phase, with category_num plus DASS/age/gender covariates) yielded a significant positive UCLA slope in confirmation (beta = 0.0460, p = 0.0278), with exploration (beta = 0.0268, p = 0.281) and exploitation (beta = 0.0101, p = 0.619) not significant. A category-by-phase-by-UCLA test using linear category_num showed no evidence of increasing UCLA effects across categories (category_num x phase x UCLA p's >= 0.279). The categorical category model produced heterogeneous slopes across categories without a monotonic increase (exploratory). An OLS check restricted to post-error trials (participant-level mean log RT) produced a marginal UCLA effect (beta = 0.0591, p = 0.0542; n_participants = 196; n_trials = 3,373).

Additional OLS checks: overall mean WCST RT was marginally associated with UCLA (beta = 64.85 ms, p = 0.0860; n = 197), and the per-participant slope of category mean RT across categories was marginally negative (beta = -19.90 ms/category, p = 0.0589; n = 193). Trial-level LMM checks did not show UCLA effects for overall mean RT (beta = 0.0199, p = 0.321) or for the category slope interaction (category_num x UCLA beta = 0.00141, p = 0.500; random intercept only). A phase-free trial-slope model showed no trial_scaled x UCLA interaction (beta = -0.00387, p = 0.856) with a strong overall trial slowdown (trial_scaled beta = -0.3799, p = 4.15e-71). A switch-cost LMM (switch vs repeat) found a robust switch main effect (beta = -0.0716, p = 4.38e-07; faster RTs on switch trials) but no switch x UCLA interaction (beta = 0.0165, p = 0.253). A correct-trial switch-slope model (trial_scaled x switch x UCLA) showed no three-way interaction (beta = 0.0436, p = 0.685), while trial_scaled x switch was positive (beta = 0.3798, p = 0.000198), suggesting switch costs increased over time in correct trials without UCLA moderation. A post-error slope model (trial_scaled x post_error x UCLA) also showed no three-way interaction (beta = -0.0148, p = 0.600), while post-error slowing remained strong (post_error beta = 0.4018, p = 5.84e-71). An OLS-equivalent segment LMM (shift_trial/post_shift_error/exploration/confirmation/exploitation) yielded a significant UCLA effect only in confirmation (beta = 0.0463, p = 0.0278), with shift_trial at trend level (beta = 0.0464, p = 0.076) and post_shift_error not significant (beta = 0.0452, p = 0.136).
