## Stroop trial-level mixed-effects check (interference slope)

We fit a trial-level mixed-effects model targeting the interference slope using congruent/incongruent trials only, condition coded as -0.5 (congruent) / +0.5 (incongruent), and a continuous within-participant trial position (trial_scaled, 0-1). RT was log-transformed; DASS subscales, age, and gender were controlled. The random-effects structure was simplified to random intercepts plus random trial_scaled slopes due to boundary warnings in the richer structure. The trial_scaled x condition x UCLA interaction (interference slope moderation) was significant (beta = 0.0580, SE = 0.0167, z = 3.469, p = 0.000522; n_trials = 13,950; n_participants = 197), while the average trial_scaled x condition slope at mean UCLA was not significant (beta = 0.0078, SE = 0.0166, p = 0.637). The richer random-effects structure (1 + trial_scaled + cond_code) yielded a similar estimate (beta = 0.0578, SE = 0.0166, p = 0.000508). An lme4 cross-check reproduced the effect (beta = 0.0580, SE = 0.0167, p = 0.000523). The participant-level quartile interference slope remained significant in the standard OLS model (beta = 19.033, SE = 6.009, p = 0.00179; n = 197).
