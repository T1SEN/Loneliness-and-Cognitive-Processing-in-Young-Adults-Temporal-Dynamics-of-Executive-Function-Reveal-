Overall CV difference (incongruent, top/bottom 25%)
N low=55, N high=55
Low mean=0.3170, sd=0.0676
High mean=0.3186, sd=0.0628
OLS HC3: cv ~ group_high (1=high) -> beta=0.0016, se=0.0126, t=0.124, p=0.9010

Time-segment CV (4 bins) with cluster-robust SE by participant
OLS cluster: cv ~ group_high + segment_c + group_high:segment_c
Segment slope (low) = 0.0020, slope (high) = 0.0176
Interaction (slope diff): beta=0.0156, se=0.0077, t=2.017, p=0.0437
