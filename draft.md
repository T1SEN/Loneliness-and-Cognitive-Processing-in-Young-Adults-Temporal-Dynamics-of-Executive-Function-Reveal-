# Results

## Participants

A total of 251 participants were initially enrolled in the study. After applying survey QC criteria, 223 participants remained for the self-report analyses. Task-specific samples varied based on completion criteria: Stroop (*N* = 220), PRP (*N* = 201), and WCST (*N* = 212). The final analysis sample with all three tasks complete consisted of 197 participants (see Figure 1).

The sample was predominantly female (61.9%, *n* = 138), with a mean age of 20.38 years (*SD* = 3.30). Participants reported moderate levels of loneliness (*M* = 40.57, *SD* = 10.99 on the UCLA Loneliness Scale), which is consistent with prior research on young adult samples.

## Correlations Among Key Variables

Bivariate correlations among self-report measures and cognitive performance indices are presented in Table 4. As expected, UCLA loneliness was strongly correlated with DASS-21 depression (*r* = .67, *p* < .001), anxiety (*r* = .50, *p* < .001), and stress (*r* = .55, *p* < .001).

Among cognitive indices, only the PRP delay effect showed a significant positive correlation with UCLA loneliness (*r* = .17, *p* < .05), suggesting that lonelier individuals exhibited larger dual-task processing costs. Neither Stroop interference (*r* = .02) nor WCST perseverative error rate (*r* = -.12) were significantly associated with loneliness at the bivariate level.

## Hierarchical Regression Analyses

To examine whether UCLA loneliness predicted executive function performance beyond the effects of general emotional distress, we conducted hierarchical regression analyses with three steps: (1) age and gender, (2) DASS-21 subscales (depression, anxiety, stress), and (3) UCLA loneliness. Significant UCLA effects (Step 3) indicate unique associations after controlling for these covariates.

### Conventional Indices (Table 5)

Among conventional cognitive indices, the core task metrics (Stroop RT interference, PRP delay effect, WCST perseverative error rate) were not significantly associated with loneliness after covariate adjustment. One additional conventional index showed a significant UCLA effect: PRP T1 Cost (Short - Long SOA) was positively associated with loneliness (*b* = 46.23, *SE* = 20.12, *p* = .023, delta R^2 = .021). This suggests that higher loneliness was associated with greater task-1 processing cost differences across SOA conditions, reflecting less flexible dual-task coordination.

Full results for all 103 conventional indices are available in Supplementary Table S1.

### Temporal Dynamics Indices (Table 6)

Temporal dynamics indices, which capture within-person performance patterns across time, revealed four significant UCLA effects:

1. **Stroop Incongruent RT Slope** (*b* = 0.44, *p* = .023): Higher loneliness was associated with increasing response times to incongruent trials across the task, suggesting progressive attentional fatigue.

2. **WCST RT Slope within Category** (*b* = -12.58, *p* = .011): Lonelier participants showed steeper RT decreases within sorting categories, potentially reflecting compensatory processing strategies.

3. **WCST Switch Cost Error k2** (*b* = 0.047, *p* = .029): Higher loneliness predicted larger error rate increases following rule switches.

4. **WCST Post-Error Slowing** (*b* = 165.89, *p* = .042): Lonelier participants exhibited greater slowing after errors, indicating more cautious post-error adjustment.

Full results for all 78 temporal dynamics indices are available in Supplementary Table S2.

## Comparison of Analytical Approaches (Figure 2)

Comparing conventional and temporal dynamics approaches, temporal indices yielded slightly higher mean incremental R^2 values across tasks (see Figure 2A). The forest plot (Figure 2B) shows that 4 of 5 significant UCLA effects came from temporal dynamics indices, with WCST showing the strongest effects (delta R^2 = .025-.038).
