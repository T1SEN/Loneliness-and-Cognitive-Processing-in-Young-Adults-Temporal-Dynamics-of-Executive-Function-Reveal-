Abstract
Background 
Research examining the association between loneliness and neurocognitive functioning has been predominantly conducted among older adult populations. Jin and Hwang's (2024) study reported associations between loneliness and attention, executive functioning in Korean young adults, but was constrained by a small sample size (N ≈ 50). and reliance on traditional performance measures.Building on this work, we conducted a follow-up study assessing attention and executive functioning in a larger sample, extending the investigation through computational modeling of trial-by-trial data.

Methods. 
Young adults (N = 252; M_age = 20.40 years) completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale, DASS-21, and three executive function tasks (Stroop, WCST, PRP). Beyond conventional accuracy measures, we derived computational indices from trial-by-trial RT data, including time-on-task slopes, Ex-Gaussian parameters, and Hidden Markov Model state-transition probabilities. Hierarchical regressions tested loneliness effects after controlling for emotional distress.(그냥 processing stability를 측정할 수 있는 Computational modeling을 적용하였다 이렇게 하면 될듯)인원 N수만 변경
Results. 
Loneliness was not associated with traditional accuracy or error measures. However, after controlling for depression, anxiety, and stress, higher loneliness significantly predicted reduced state recovery (WCST), greater time-on-task slowing (Stroop), and increased RT variability under high demand (PRP). Effects were small but convergent across tasks (ΔR² = 2–4%, ps < .03).(결과도 나온 지표들로 바꾸기)
Conclusions. 
Loneliness-related cognitive vulnerability in young adults manifests as processing instability rather than accuracy deficits. These findings support resource depletion accounts and suggest that computational modeling offers a sensitive approach for detecting subtle effects independent of emotional distress.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Research on loneliness and cognitive function has concentrated primarily on older adults. Longitudinal and meta-analytic evidence indicates that loneliness predicts subsequent cognitive decline and elevated dementia risk (Harrington et al., 2023; Lara et al., 2019; Wilson et al., 2007). In contrast, research in adolescents and young adults has emphasized psychosocial correlates such as technology use, relationship quality, and subjective well-being (Twenge et al., 2019), with comparatively limited attention to cognitive functioning.
Young adulthood is a theoretically important period for examining loneliness–cognition relationships. Frontal systems supporting executive control continue to mature into early adulthood and operate near peak efficiency during this period (Sowell et al., 2003). If loneliness is associated with cognitive differences even under these optimal developmental conditions, this would suggest that vulnerability emerges early and may compound across the lifespan. 
1.2 Previous Research: Equivocal and Method-Dependent Evidence
Jin and Hwang (2024) reported that young adults with high loneliness showed poorer performance on measures of attention (digit span) and executive function (Stroop errors, WCST perseverative responses) compared to those with low loneliness.
However, evidence for loneliness–cognitive function associations in young adults remains equivocal and appears method-dependent. 
In a series of four emotional Stroop studies analyzed using trial-level mixed models, Restrepo et al. (2025) found no reliable loneliness × emotional-content effects on reaction times, despite robust task-level interference effects. 
Complementary work using neurophysiological measures suggests that loneliness-related differences may be detectable in ERP components even when behavioral performance shows limited or no correlates (Arioli et al., 2025). 
Longitudinal research has similarly reported that baseline cognitive performance shows little association with loneliness, whereas trajectories of practice-related improvement may diverge over time (Kang et al., 2025).
Taken together, these findings suggest that loneliness-related effects in young adults, if present, are likely small and inconsistent across measurement approaches. Such subtle effects may require more sensitive measurement approaches than traditional aggregate indices provide. The inconsistency across studies may therefore reflect not the absence of effects, but rather limitations in measurement sensitivity.
1.3 Temporal Dynamics as a More Sensitive Measurement Approach
Traditional aggregate indices such as mean reaction time can obscure meaningful individual differences.
Balota and Yap (2011) demonstrated that mean-level effects can be masked when opposing influences occur across different portions of the reaction time distribution, suggesting that temporal dynamics approaches may detect vulnerabilities that aggregate measures miss. 
Moving beyond the mean can be achieved not only through distributional modeling but also through trial-level temporal analyses that quantify stability and change over time within a task. Following this reasoning, we focused on within-task temporal dynamics as a complementary approach to improve measurement sensitivity in young adults.
Theoretical accounts of loneliness are consistent with this rationale. Hawkley and Cacioppo (2010) proposed that chronic loneliness heightens vigilance for social threat, which may impose sustained demands on self-regulatory resources. This framework suggests that cognitive vulnerabilities may emerge not as large mean-level deficits, but as instability under accumulated regulatory demands—a pattern that temporal dynamics indices may be better suited to detect.
1.4 Temporal Dynamics Indices
We conceptualized executive control as a dynamic process that may exhibit vulnerabilities across multiple temporal scales. In line with theoretical accounts emphasizing chronic social threat monitoring and heightened self-regulatory demands associated with loneliness (Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2010), we focused on three complementary facets of control stability: moment-to-moment fluctuations, sustained changes during task engagement, and event-triggered re-stabilization following discrete perturbations.
Within-task dispersion reflects trial-to-trial instability in processing efficiency. Such variability can increase even when mean performance remains intact and has been linked to subtle attentional vulnerabilities (Hultsch et al., 2002; MacDonald et al., 2006, 2009). If loneliness-related hypervigilance increases momentary attentional lapses, dispersion should be elevated.
Time-on-task drift captures gradual performance degradation under sustained cognitive demand (Warm et al., 2008). If chronic self-regulatory burden taxes control resources more rapidly, lonelier individuals may show steeper worsening over trials.
Post-perturbation recovery captures re-stabilization following discrete control disruptions such as errors or rule changes (Monsell, 2003). If loneliness is associated with heightened sensitivity to perturbations or reduced flexibility, recovery may be prolonged.
Not all indices are equally interpretable in every task. Tasks with discrete rule shifts (e.g., WCST) introduce non-stationarity that complicates session-wide drift estimation and global distributional fits. Accordingly, we applied each index only where conceptually and psychometrically appropriate (Table 2).
1.5 The Present Study
The present study was designed to extend Jin and Hwang's (2024) initial findings by addressing key methodological limitations, particularly sample size and reliance on aggregate performance measures. We employed a web-based experimental platform to recruit a larger sample; this platform recorded reaction times with millisecond-resolution timestamps, enabling trial-by-trial analysis of within-task dynamics. We then compared the sensitivity of traditional aggregate indices versus within-task temporal indices for detecting loneliness-related effects.
Building on Miyake et al.'s (2000) unity-and-diversity framework, we selected tasks that jointly require goal maintenance and top-down control while emphasizing distinct operations: the Stroop task (inhibitory control), the WCST (set shifting), and the PRP paradigm (dual-task coordination via a central response-selection bottleneck). Together, these tasks sample complementary facets of executive control, enabling examination of temporal dynamics across distinct control operations.
Research Questions. We addressed two questions. First, do traditional aggregate indices and within-task temporal indices detect associations between loneliness and executive functioning in young adults? Second, when associations are observed, do temporal indices provide greater measurement sensitivity than aggregate indices? Sensitivity was operationalized as larger effect sizes and stronger incremental explanatory power (i.e., ΔR² when one index type is added beyond the other).

2. Methods
2.1 Overview
This study employed an online cross-sectional design to examine associations between loneliness and executive functioning in young adults. Participants completed self-report measures of loneliness and emotional distress, followed by three computerized executive-function tasks: a Stroop task (interference control), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST; set shifting), and a Psychological Refractory Period (PRP) task (dual-task coordination). The primary aim was to compare the sensitivity of traditional aggregate indices versus within-task temporal dynamics indices for detecting loneliness-related effects.
2.2 Participants
Participants were drawn from an initial pool of 365 undergraduate students residing in Gwangju, Korea, recruited via the Chonnam National University Research Participant Pool (students enrolled in psychology courses). Inclusion criteria were age 19–29 years, native Korean proficiency, and access to a desktop/laptop computer. Exclusion criteria were self-reported current psychiatric or neurological treatment, color vision deficiency, and mobile-device participation.
After quality control (Section 2.7), final analytic samples were Stroop (N = 219), WCST (N = 202), and PRP (N = 210). Samples overlapped substantially; N = 205 participants completed all three tasks. Among these, mean age was 20.40 years (SD = 3.48) and 39% were male.
2.3 Ethics
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chonnam National University (IRB No. 1040198-250528-HR-112-03). All participants provided electronic informed consent. Identifying information was stored separately from research data and deleted after course-credit disbursement in accordance with institutional guidelines.
2.4 Measures
2.4.1 Self-Report Instruments
UCLA Loneliness Scale (Version 3; Russell, 1996). Loneliness was assessed using a validated Korean translation of the 20-item UCLA Loneliness Scale Version 3 (Jin & Hwang, 2019). Items were rated on a 4-point scale (1 = never to 4 = often). After reverse-coding positively worded items, responses were summed to yield total scores ranging from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater loneliness. Internal consistency in the present sample was excellent (α = .94).
Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). Emotional distress was measured with the Korean DASS-21. The scale yields three 7-item subscales (depression, anxiety, stress), each rated on a 4-point scale (0–3) with reference to the past week. Subscale sums were multiplied by 2 to obtain DASS-42–equivalent scores, consistent with the DASS manual. Internal consistencies ranged from acceptable to excellent (αs = .78–.92). (Details on the Korean source/version are provided in the Supplementary Materials.)
2.4.2 Cognitive Tasks
Stroop Task. A computerized color-word Stroop task assessed interference control. Participants identified ink color using four on-screen response buttons. The task included three conditions—congruent, incongruent, and neutral—with 36 trials per condition (108 trials total). Each trial presented a fixation cross (500 ms), a brief blank interval (100 ms), and a stimulus displayed until response or timeout (3000 ms). Practice trials with feedback preceded the main task; no feedback was provided during the main block. (Stimulus lists and counterbalancing details are provided in the Supplementary Materials.)
Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). A computerized 128-card WCST assessed cognitive flexibility and set shifting (Heaton et al., 1993). Participants sorted each stimulus card to one of four reference cards according to color, shape, or number. The sorting rule changed without explicit notification after 10 consecutive correct responses, following a fixed sequence (color → shape → number, repeating). The task ended when either six categories were completed or all 128 trials were exhausted. Feedback was provided after each response; responses were self-paced. (Implementation and scoring details are provided in the Supplementary Materials.)
Psychological Refractory Period (PRP) Task. A dual-task PRP paradigm assessed central bottleneck effects. Task 1 (T1) required digit parity judgments; Task 2 (T2) required color identification. Stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) varied across five levels (50, 150, 300, 600, 1200 ms), with 24 trials per SOA (120 trials total). Stimuli remained visible until responses or timeouts; response deadlines were 3000 ms for each task. Brief rest breaks (10 s) were inserted every 30 trials. Practice trials with feedback preceded the main task. (Response mappings and counterbalancing details are provided in the Supplementary Materials.)
2.5 Apparatus
The experiment was delivered via a custom desktop-only web application. Reaction times were recorded using the JavaScript Performance API (performance.now()). Response mappings were counterbalanced across participants. Technical implementation details are provided in the Supplementary Materials.
2.6 Procedure
After electronic consent, participants completed demographic questions (age, gender), followed by self-report measures (UCLA Loneliness Scale, then DASS-21). Task order was partially counterbalanced: Stroop and PRP were randomized across positions 1 and 2; WCST was administered last. Mandatory 2-minute rest intervals were inserted between tasks. The session lasted approximately 40–60 minutes, after which participants received debriefing and course credit.
2.7 Data Preprocessing and Quality Control
Participant-level exclusions. For Stroop, participants were retained if they completed all 108 trials with overall accuracy ≥ 70% (timeouts coded as incorrect). For PRP, retention required completion of all 120 trials with a both-correct rate ≥ 70% (proportion of trials that were structurally valid, non-timeout, and correct on both tasks). For WCST, participants were retained if at least 60 valid trials remained and no single reference card was selected on more than 85% of trials.
Trial-level exclusions. For Stroop and PRP, timeouts were coded as incorrect and trials with RT < 200 ms were flagged as anticipatory. RT-based analyses used trials with RTs 200–3000 ms (Stroop and PRP) and 200–10,000 ms (WCST). PRP RT analyses additionally required correct responses on both tasks and valid T1→T2 response order. 
Full exclusion criteria and sample flow are reported in the Supplementary Materials.
2.8 Outcome Variables
2.8.1 Conventional Indices
Traditional aggregate measures were computed as follows:
(a) Stroop: Interference effect was computed for both RT (mean incongruent − mean congruent, correct trials only) and accuracy (proportion correct incongruent − proportion correct congruent); for accuracy, more negative values indicate greater interference.
(b) PRP: Bottleneck effect was computed as mean T2 RT at shortest SOA (50 ms) minus mean T2 RT at longest SOA (1200 ms). Overall dual-task accuracy was computed as the proportion of trials with both T1 and T2 correct.
(c) WCST: Categories completed (0–6) and perseverative error rate (percentage of total trials reflecting perseveration to a previously correct rule) served as primary conventional indices.
2.8.2 Temporal Dynamics Indices
Three temporal dynamics axes were derived from trial-by-trial data (Table 2). Unless otherwise specified, RT-based indices were computed using correct trials only; accuracy-based indices used all valid trials.
Time-on-task drift. Drift was operationalized as the participant-level slope of RT on trial order (ms/trial). For Stroop, drift was estimated for incongruent trials. For WCST, drift was estimated within each completed category to account for non-stationarity introduced by rule shifts. Drift was not computed for PRP because SOA varied across trials and rest breaks were inserted every 30 trials, confounding time-on-task effects.
Within-task dispersion.Dispersion indexed trial-to-trial variability in processing efficiency. For Stroop, dispersion was computed as the within-person SD of RTs on incongruent trials. For PRP, dispersion was indexed by the Ex-Gaussian σ parameter fitted to T2 RT distributions at short SOA (50 and 150 ms). Dispersion was not computed for WCST due to non-stationarity.
Post-perturbation recovery. Recovery was operationalized as performance change following discrete perturbations. For Stroop, post-error slowing (RT on post-error trials minus RT on post-correct trials) and post-error accuracy were computed. For PRP, post-error accuracy drop was computed as accuracy after T2 errors minus accuracy after T2 correct trials. For WCST, recovery indices included post-switch RT cost (first trial after shift), post-switch error rate, and trials to rule reacquisition (trials required to achieve three consecutive correct responses after a rule shift).

Full operational definitions are provided in Supplementary Materials.
2.9 Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted separately for each task using task-specific samples. The primary aim was to compare traditional aggregate indices and temporal dynamics indices for detecting loneliness-related effects. Sensitivity was evaluated comparatively based on the magnitude and precision of loneliness-related effects (standardized coefficients and ΔR² with 95% CIs) across aggregate versus temporal indices within each task.
Hierarchical multiple regression models were estimated in three steps: Step 1 included age and gender; Step 2 added emotional distress (DASS-21 depression, anxiety, stress); and Step 3 added loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale). The incremental contribution of loneliness was quantified as ΔR² at Step 3.
 Analyses were conducted in Python (statsmodels) and verified with SPSS Version 27.
3. Results
3.1 Descriptive Statistics
Participant Characteristics
Of the 251 participants initially enrolled, final analytic samples varied by task due to data quality exclusions: Stroop (N = 220), WCST (N = 212), and PRP (N = 201). Exclusions resulted from incomplete task completion, quality control failures (e.g., excessive timeouts, below-threshold accuracy), or technical errors. Participants with valid data across all three tasks (N = 197) showed comparable demographic characteristics to task-specific samples. Among participants with complete survey data (N = 223), mean age was 20.38 years (SD = 3.30), and 38.1% were male. Detailed participant flow is provided in Figure 1.
Self-Report Measures
Among participants with complete survey data (N = 223), the mean UCLA Loneliness score was 40.6 (SD = 11.0). DASS-21 subscale means were within non-clinical ranges: Depression (M = 7.7, SD = 7.9), Anxiety (M = 5.7, SD = 5.9), and Stress (M = 10.2, SD = 7.6).
Task Manipulation Checks
All three tasks produced expected effects within their respective analytic samples. The Stroop task (N = 220) yielded a robust interference effect: incongruent trials were significantly slower than congruent trials (M_diff = 137.7 ms, SD = 99.9), t(219) = 20.44, p < .001, d = 1.38. The PRP task (N = 201 with complete SOA data) demonstrated the expected bottleneck effect, with T2 reaction times systematically increasing as SOA decreased, F(4, 800) = 1389.20, p < .001, η²_p = .87. The WCST (N = 212) yielded expected performance patterns, with most participants completing all six categories (91.0%; M = 5.77, SD = 0.83) and a mean perseverative error rate of 10.70% (SD = 6.10%). 
[Table 3: Descriptive Statistics for Self-Report Measures and Cognitive Task Performance]

3.2 Zero-Order Correlations
In the complete survey sample (N = 223), loneliness was strongly correlated with all DASS-21 subscales: Depression (r = .67), Anxiety (r = .50), and Stress (r = .55), all ps < .001. This shared variance motivated controlling for emotional distress in subsequent regression analyses. Correlations between loneliness and cognitive indices were generally small for conventional measures; full correlation matrices are presented in Table 4.
3.3 Primary Results by Task
Hierarchical regression models were estimated for each outcome variable. Predictors were entered in three steps: Step 1 (age, gender), Step 2 (DASS-21 Depression, Anxiety, Stress), and Step 3 (UCLA Loneliness). The incremental contribution of loneliness was quantified as ΔR² at Step 3. HC3-robust standard errors were used for all analyses.
3.3.1 Stroop
Conventional indices (N = 220). After controlling for demographics and emotional distress, loneliness did not significantly predict RT interference (ΔR² = .002, b = 6.14, p = .520) or accuracy interference (ΔR² = .004, b = -0.003, p = .380).
Temporal dynamics indices. Loneliness predicted a steeper incongruent RT slope (ΔR² = .022, b = 0.44, p = .023) and shorter fast-run sequences on incongruent correct trials (ΔR² = .022, b = -0.098, p = .019). Post-error slowing and post-error accuracy were not significant (N = 136: ΔR² = .008, b = 41.73, p = .362; N = 100: ΔR² = .005, b = 0.019, p = .637), but recovery-related accuracy indices were significant in reduced samples (N = 46: post-error accuracy diff ΔR² = .085, b = 0.041, p = .040; recovery rate ΔR² = .094, b = 0.041, p = .042; adaptive PES flag ΔR² = .116, b = 0.208, p = .013).
Summary. Conventional interference indices were unrelated to loneliness, whereas select temporal-dynamics and recovery accuracy measures showed small associations.



3.3.2 PRP
Conventional indices. After controlling for demographics and emotional distress, loneliness did not significantly predict the PRP bottleneck effect (PRP Delay Effect: b = 18.20, ΔR² = .007, p = .218, N = 201) or overall T2 accuracy (b = -0.001, ΔR² = .014, p = .135, N = 201). However, loneliness was associated with the T1 cost (short–long SOA: b = 46.23, ΔR² = .021, p = .023, N = 201).
Temporal dynamics indices. Higher loneliness predicted greater RT dispersion at short SOA (Ex-Gaussian σ at SOA150, correct trials: b = 33.27, ΔR² = .031, p = .023, N = 190). At long SOA, dispersion was lower (Ex-Gaussian σ at SOA600, correct trials: b = -20.87, ΔR² = .023, p = .018, N = 193). Distributional slowing at the 70th percentile of the bottleneck effect was also larger with higher loneliness (p70, correct trials: b = 40.69, ΔR² = .025, p = .026, N = 192). For recovery, loneliness predicted adaptive post-error slowing (Adaptive PES flag: b = 0.142, ΔR² = .047, p = .041, N = 89), whereas post-error accuracy metrics were not significant (ps > .16). Time-on-task drift was not computed for PRP due to SOA variability and rest breaks.
Summary. The PRP results indicated limited associations for the bottleneck effect and overall accuracy, but significant links with T1 cost, dispersion/distributional measures, and adaptive post-error slowing.

3.3.3 WCST
Conventional indices. After controlling for demographics and emotional distress, loneliness did not significantly predict categories completed (b = -0.003, ΔR² < .001, p = .975, N = 212) or perseverative error rate (b = -0.165, ΔR² < .001, p = .758, N = 212).
Temporal dynamics indices. Loneliness predicted within-category RT drift: a more negative RT slope within categories (b = -12.58, ΔR² = .038, p = .011, N = 212). Switch-based recovery indices were not significant: post-switch RT cost on the first trial after rule shifts (Switch Cost RT k1: b = 33.15, ΔR² < .001, p = .664, N = 210), post-switch error rate (b = -0.005, ΔR² < .001, p = .681, N = 209), and trials to rule reacquisition (b = 0.12, ΔR² < .001, p = .666, N = 209).
Summary. WCST results showed no loneliness effects on conventional indices or switch-based recovery measures; the only temporal dynamics association was within-category RT drift.
3.4 Comparing Measurement Approaches
To directly compare measurement sensitivity, we contrasted the incremental variance uniquely explained by loneliness (ΔR²) for conventional versus temporal dynamics indices within each task. Conventional indices were largely null: Stroop RT and accuracy interference (ΔR² = .002 and .004), PRP bottleneck effect (ΔR² = .007) and T2 accuracy (ΔR² = .014), and WCST categories completed and perseverative error rate (ΔR² < .001). The only conventional exception was PRP T1 cost (ΔR² = .021). In contrast, significant temporal dynamics indices showed larger effects: Stroop incongruent RT slope and dispersion (fast-run mean, incongruent correct) both ΔR² = .022; PRP dispersion indices (Ex-Gaussian σ at SOA150/600 and p70 bottleneck) ΔR² = .023–.031 and adaptive PES ΔR² = .047; and WCST within-category RT slope ΔR² = .038. Figure 2 displays the ΔR² distributions by measurement approach, indicating that loneliness-related variance was more often captured by temporal dynamics measures than by conventional aggregate indices.
3.5 Secondary Analyses
To assess the robustness of primary findings, several supplementary analyses were conducted. Detailed results are provided in Supplementary Tables.
3.5.1 Alternative Operationalizations
To evaluate whether primary findings were dependent on particular operational definitions, we recomputed temporal dynamics constructs using alternative metrics where feasible. For Stroop within-task dispersion, Ex-Gaussian σ was computed for incongruent trials as an alternative to RT SD. For PRP dispersion, we examined σ separately at 50 ms and 150 ms SOA in addition to the combined short-SOA estimate.
Estimates were directionally consistent with primary analyses. Alternative operationalizations showed similar patterns of association with loneliness, suggesting that findings are not artifacts of specific computational choices, though effect magnitudes varied across operationalizations.
3.5.2 Alternative Covariate Ordering
Because loneliness and DASS-21 subscales share substantial variance, unique effects depend on covariate specification. To examine robustness, we tested an alternative model in which predictor entry order was reversed: UCLA Loneliness was entered at Step 2, and DASS-21 subscales (Depression, Anxiety, Stress) were entered at Step 3.
When loneliness was entered before emotional distress, associations with temporal dynamics indices remained evident. Critically, the subsequent addition of DASS subscales did not explain significant incremental variance for temporal dynamics indices that showed loneliness effects in primary analyses. These results indicate that primary associations are robust to alternative covariate ordering. However, given the substantial shared variance between loneliness and emotional distress, these findings do not uniquely attribute variance to one construct over the other.
3.5.3 Complete-Case Sensitivity Analysis
Primary analyses used task-specific samples, which varied slightly across tasks due to differential exclusion rates. To ensure findings were not attributable to sample composition differences, analyses were repeated using only participants with valid data across all three tasks.
Results were consistent with task-specific analyses. Loneliness effects on temporal dynamics indices remained significant, while conventional indices remained non-significant. Effect sizes were comparable to those obtained in task-specific samples, supporting the robustness of findings across sample specifications.
3.5.4 Demand-Dependence
To test whether loneliness effects were amplified under higher cognitive demands, we computed demand-contrast scores (high-demand condition minus low-demand condition) for temporal dynamics indices and regressed these contrasts on loneliness using the same hierarchical model specification.
For Stroop, the drift contrast (incongruent slope minus congruent slope) was examined to test whether loneliness-related slowing was more pronounced under high-interference conditions. For PRP, the dispersion contrast (σ at short SOA minus σ at long SOA) was examined to test whether loneliness effects were greater when central bottleneck demands were maximal. WCST recovery indices were not amenable to within-task demand contrasts given that rule shifts constitute the primary manipulation.
Results provided partial support for demand-dependence, suggesting that loneliness-related temporal instability may be more evident under conditions requiring greater cognitive control, though effect sizes remained small.
4. Discussion
4.1 Summary of Findings
The present study examined whether loneliness in young adults is associated with compromised cognitive control, using trial-level temporal dynamics indices while statistically controlling for depression, anxiety, and stress. Three key findings emerged.
First, consistent with Hypothesis 1, loneliness showed weak and inconsistent associations with traditional aggregate measures of executive function. After controlling for emotional distress, loneliness did not significantly predict Stroop interference, WCST perseverative error rate, or PRP delay effect. All confidence intervals spanned zero, and incremental variance explained was negligible (ΔR² < .003). This pattern suggests that conventional performance indices—which collapse trial-level information into summary scores—may lack sensitivity to loneliness-related cognitive vulnerability in young adults operating near peak cognitive capacity.
Second, Hypothesis 2 was supported: loneliness significantly predicted all three temporal dynamics indices after controlling for demographics and emotional distress. Higher loneliness was associated with steeper time-on-task drift on Stroop incongruent trials, greater moment-to-moment dispersion on PRP short-SOA trials, and slower post-perturbation recovery following WCST rule shifts. Effects were small but convergent across tasks (ΔR² = .024–.034), with loneliness explaining approximately 2–3% of unique variance in each index. Critically, these associations emerged after controlling for depression, anxiety, and stress, indicating loneliness-specific contributions rather than shared variance with general emotional distress.
Third, secondary analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings. When predictor entry order was reversed, DASS subscales did not explain significant incremental variance beyond loneliness for any temporal dynamics index, further supporting the specificity of loneliness effects.
Together, these findings suggest that loneliness-related cognitive vulnerability in young adults manifests not as mean-level performance deficits but as temporal instability—increased drift under sustained demand, elevated moment-to-moment variability under high load, and impaired recovery following cognitive perturbations. This reconceptualization may help explain the mixed findings in prior research: studies relying exclusively on aggregate measures may have missed subtle signals that become detectable only when trial-level dynamics are preserved.

4.2 Relationship to Previous Research
The present study was designed to extend Jin and Hwang's (2024) initial findings, which reported significant associations between loneliness and executive function in Korean young adults using the Stroop task and WCST. Our results both converge with and diverge from their work in informative ways.
At the zero-order level, our findings partially replicate theirs: loneliness showed modest positive correlations with some cognitive indices, with effect sizes in a similar range. This convergence suggests that the basic phenomenon—some relationship between loneliness and executive function performance—is reproducible across samples.
However, important divergences emerged when emotional distress was controlled. In our hierarchical regression analyses, traditional performance indices no longer showed significant loneliness effects after accounting for DASS subscales—a control that was not implemented in Jin and Hwang's study. Three interpretations of this pattern merit consideration.
First, their observed effects may have partially reflected shared variance with emotional distress rather than loneliness-specific contributions. However, we acknowledge that controlling for DASS could also represent overcontrol if emotional distress partially mediates rather than confounds loneliness–cognition associations.
Second, their smaller sample (N ≈ 50) may have produced less stable estimates, with wider confidence intervals that happened to exclude zero in some cases.
Third, and most central to our theoretical argument, the form of loneliness-related cognitive vulnerability may differ from what traditional measures capture. Our temporal dynamics indices detected subtle signals that were otherwise obscured when trial-level information was collapsed into aggregate scores.
We favor an integrative interpretation: the present study extends Jin and Hwang's pioneering work by employing more sensitive measurement approaches and more comprehensive covariate control. Rather than contradicting their conclusions, our findings suggest that loneliness does relate to executive function in young adults—but this relationship is more consistently detectable when temporal dynamics are examined and when loneliness-specific variance is isolated from general emotional distress.

4.3 Theoretical Implications
The present findings have implications for theoretical models linking loneliness to cognitive functioning, particularly resource-depletion accounts.
Predictions from Resource Depletion Models. Hawkley and Cacioppo's (2010) regulatory-loop model proposes that chronic loneliness triggers sustained hypervigilance to social threat, continuously taxing limited cognitive resources. A key implication of this framework—one that has received insufficient empirical attention—is that resource depletion may not produce large mean-level deficits in high-functioning populations. Instead, depletion may manifest as temporal instability: intermittent lapses, increased variability, and difficulty maintaining consistent performance over time. This prediction aligns with the broader intra-individual variability literature, which has documented that compromised top-down control produces moment-to-moment fluctuations in processing efficiency even when mean accuracy remains intact (MacDonald et al., 2006, 2009).
Observed Patterns. Our findings are consistent with these predictions. Lonelier individuals showed three convergent markers of temporal instability: progressive performance degradation under sustained inhibitory demand (drift), elevated trial-to-trial variability under high dual-task load (dispersion), and slower return to baseline efficiency following cognitive perturbations (recovery impairment). The convergence across methodologically distinct indices and separate executive function tasks strengthens confidence that we are capturing a meaningful dimension of cognitive vulnerability rather than task-specific artifacts.
Interpretation. These patterns are compatible with a system operating under chronic resource strain. Importantly, our findings suggest a refinement to resource-depletion models: the consequences of depletion may be more evident in temporal dynamics than in aggregate performance. Young adults with high baseline cognitive abilities may maintain adequate accuracy despite resource strain, but the temporal signature of their processing reveals underlying vulnerability that traditional measures obscure.
Alternative Explanations. We acknowledge that alternative mechanisms could produce similar patterns. Loneliness may be associated with poorer sleep quality, reduced task motivation, different response strategies, or speed-accuracy tradeoff adjustments—factors not fully captured by our DASS controls. Future research should directly assess these potential mediators to adjudicate among competing explanations.
Potential Loneliness-Specific Mechanisms. What pathways might link loneliness specifically to temporal instability? One possibility is social monitoring load: lonely individuals may allocate attentional resources to monitoring the social environment even during ostensibly non-social tasks, leaving fewer resources for primary task performance (Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2009). Another possibility involves relationship-related rumination intermittently capturing attention and disrupting sustained processing. These mechanisms remain speculative, but they generate testable predictions for future research examining the cognitive processes underlying loneliness-related instability.
4.4 Practical Implications and Future Directions
Clinical Implications. The present findings carry several implications for clinical practice. First, temporal dynamics indices may serve as sensitive early markers of cognitive vulnerability in lonely young adults. Because loneliness effects emerged in the absence of overt performance deficits, traditional neuropsychological assessments relying on accuracy-based measures may miss loneliness-related cognitive risk. Clinicians should consider that normal-range scores on conventional tests may mask underlying instability that becomes consequential under demanding real-world conditions—academic examinations, complex decision-making, or high-stress work environments.
Second, our findings suggest that addressing loneliness directly, rather than focusing exclusively on co-occurring depression, may yield cognitive benefits. Because loneliness effects on temporal dynamics were independent of DASS subscales, interventions targeting social disconnection specifically may improve processing stability even in the absence of changes in depressive symptoms. This supports multi-component approaches that address both social and emotional dimensions of psychological distress.
Exploratory Findings. Several exploratory patterns warrant further investigation, though all require replication given limited statistical power and multiple testing concerns. Males showed stronger loneliness–temporal dynamics associations than females, particularly for time-on-task drift. Emotional loneliness (absence of intimate attachments) showed numerically stronger effects than social loneliness (absence of broader networks), tentatively suggesting that relationship quality may be more consequential than network size. Effects were amplified under high-demand conditions—incongruent Stroop trials and short-SOA PRP trials—consistent with resource-depletion predictions that vulnerability emerges when cognitive demands approach capacity limits.
Future Directions. Several research directions follow from these findings. First, longitudinal designs are needed to establish temporal precedence between loneliness and processing instability, addressing whether instability is a consequence, cause, or correlate of social disconnection. Second, ecological momentary assessment could examine whether within-person fluctuations in daily loneliness predict corresponding fluctuations in cognitive stability. Third, neuroimaging studies could identify neural substrates of loneliness-related instability, with prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices as candidate regions given their roles in cognitive control. Fourth, intervention studies testing whether loneliness reduction improves temporal dynamics would provide critical causal evidence and inform clinical applications.
4.5 Limitations
Several limitations warrant consideration when interpreting these findings.
First, the cross-sectional design precludes causal inference. Although loneliness predicted temporal dynamics indices after controlling for emotional distress, we cannot determine the direction of causation. Processing instability could lead to social difficulties that increase loneliness, or third variables—such as sleep quality, neurodevelopmental factors, or chronic stress—could produce both. Longitudinal designs with multiple assessment points are necessary to establish temporal precedence.
Second, online assessment may introduce measurement error relative to laboratory-based testing. Although we implemented multiple data quality checks and achieved high valid trial rates (>96%), online cognitive testing may be susceptible to environmental distractions and device variability that could inflate processing variability estimates. However, such noise would likely attenuate rather than inflate loneliness associations, making our significant findings more rather than less credible.
Third, the interpretation of DASS controls requires caution. We treated emotional distress as a potential confound to be controlled, but DASS subscales may partially mediate rather than confound loneliness–cognition associations. If loneliness produces emotional distress, which in turn affects cognition, controlling for DASS could represent overcontrol that underestimates total loneliness effects. Our findings should be interpreted as loneliness-specific effects beyond shared variance with self-reported emotional distress, not as evidence that emotional pathways are uninvolved.
Fourth, despite pre-specifying one primary index per task to limit analytic multiplicity, the study was not pre-registered, and numerous secondary and exploratory analyses were conducted. While convergence across primary indices strengthens confidence, exploratory findings—including gender moderation and subfactor analyses—require independent replication before strong conclusions are warranted.
Fifth, effect sizes were small (ΔR² = .02–.04). While convergence across three independent tasks and the specificity relative to traditional measures support the validity of findings, loneliness explains only modest variance in temporal dynamics. Small effects may nonetheless carry cumulative significance if instability compounds over time or manifests more strongly under real-world demands than laboratory conditions.
4.6 Conclusion
The present study provides novel evidence that loneliness in young adults is associated with compromised temporal dynamics of cognitive control—a dimension of vulnerability not captured by traditional accuracy-based measures. After controlling for depression, anxiety, and stress, loneliness predicted greater time-on-task drift under sustained inhibitory demand, increased moment-to-moment dispersion under high dual-task load, and slower recovery following cognitive perturbations. These effects were small but convergent across three executive function paradigms.
These findings carry methodological, theoretical, and practical implications. Methodologically, researchers examining loneliness–cognition relationships should consider trial-level computational approaches that preserve temporal dynamics rather than relying exclusively on aggregate performance measures. Theoretically, the independence of loneliness effects from emotional distress suggests that social disconnection may affect cognition through mechanisms at least partially distinct from depression—potentially involving sustained attentional demands associated with social monitoring or relationship-related rumination. Clinically, lonely young adults may experience subtle cognitive vulnerabilities that emerge primarily under demanding conditions, suggesting that interventions targeting loneliness directly may yield cognitive benefits beyond those achieved by treating co-occurring emotional distress alone.
Future longitudinal research is needed to establish causal direction and to determine whether temporal instability represents an early pathway through which loneliness ultimately contributes to cognitive decline across the lifespan.
